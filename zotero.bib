  abstract = {This study addresses the dynamic object detection problem for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) in marine environments, which is complicated by boat tilting and camera illumination sensitivity. A novel pipeline named ``Seal'' is proposed to enhance detection accuracy and reliability. The approach begins with an innovative preprocessing stage that integrates data from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with LiDAR sensors to correct tilt-induced distortions in LiDAR point cloud data and reduce ripple effects around objects. The adjusted data are grouped using clustering algorithms and bounding boxes for precise object localization. Additionally, a specialized Kalman filter tailored for maritime environments mitigates object discontinuities between successive frames and addresses data sparsity caused by boat tilting. The methodology was evaluated using the VRX simulator, with experiments conducted on the Volga River using real USVs. The preprocessing effectiveness was assessed using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and tracking accuracy was evaluated through detection rate metrics. The results demonstrate a 25\% to 30\% improvement in detection accuracy and show that the pipeline can aid industry even with sparse object representation across different frames. This study highlights the potential of integrating sensor fusion with specialized tracking for accurate dynamic object detection in maritime settings, establishing a new benchmark for USV navigation systems' accuracy and reliability.},

In particular, unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs), including unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), have the potential to complete maritime tasks that are unachievable for manned vehicles, lower the risk of man power, raise the power required to carry out military missions, and reap huge economic benefits. The aim of this review is to identify past and current trends in UMV development and present insights into future UMV development. The review discusses the potential benefits of UMVs, including completing maritime tasks that are unachievable for manned vehicles, lowering the risk of human intervention, and increasing power for military missions and economic benefits. However, the development of UMVs has been relatively tardy compared to that of UVs used on the ground and in the air due to adverse environments for UMV operation. This review highlights the challenges in developing UMVs, particularly in adverse environments, and the need for continued advancements in communication and networking technologies, navigation and sound exploration technologies, and multivehicle mission planning technologies to improve UMV cooperation and intelligence. Furthermore, the review identifies the importance of incorporating AI and machine learning technologies in UMVs to enhance their autonomy and ability to perform complex tasks. Overall, this review provides insights into the current state and future directions for UMV development.},

Intelligent vessels are being developed into unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which have widely interested scholars in the shipping industry due to their safety, high efficiency, and energy-saving qualities. Considering the current development of USVs, the types of USVs and applications domestically and internationally are being investigated. USVs emerged with technological developments and their characteristics show some differences from traditional vessels, which brings some problems and advantages for their application. Certain maritime regulations are not applicable to USVs and must be changed. The key technologies in the current development of USVs are being investigated. While the level of intelligence is improving, the protection of cargo cannot be neglected. An innovative approach to the internal structure of USVs is proposed, where the inner hull can automatically recover its original state in case of outer hull tilting. Finally, we summarize the development status of USVs, which are an inevitable direction of development in the marine field.},

  abstract = {We propose LU-Net - for LiDAR U-Net, a new method for the semantic segmentation of a 3D LiDAR point cloud. Instead of applying some global 3D segmentation method such as PointNet, we propose an end-to-end architecture for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation that efficiently solves the problem as an image processing problem. We first extract high-level 3D features for each point given its 3D neighbors. Then, these features are projected into a 2D multichannel range-image by considering the topology of the sensor. Thanks to these learned features and this projection, we can finally perform the segmentation using a simple U-Net segmentation network, which performs very well while being very efficient. In this way, we can exploit both the 3D nature of the data and the specificity of the LiDAR sensor. This approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on the KITTI dataset, as our experiments show. Moreover, this approach operates at 24fps on a single GPU. This is above the acquisition rate of common LiDAR sensors which makes it suitable for real-time applications.},

  abstract = {Deploying robots to explore venues that are inaccessible to humans, or simply inhospitable, has been a longstanding ambition of scientists, engineers, and explorers across numerous fields. The deep sea exemplifies an environment that is largely uncharted and denies human presence. Central to exploration is the capacity to deliver dexterous robotic manipulation to this unstructured environment. Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) are successful in providing passive solutions for observation and mapping but currently are far from capable of delivering human-level dexterity. The ones providing manipulation typically are UUVs coupled with position-controlled hydraulic arms using disjoint controllers for navigation and manipulation that require expert operators. Ocean One is a humanoid underwater robot designed specifically for underwater manipulation. In this paper, we present Ocean One's control architecture that, through a collaboration between this humanoid robot and a human pilot, enables the deployment of dexterous robotic manipulation to the deep sea. We provide detailed descriptions of this architecture's two main components: first, a whole-body controller that creates functional autonomy by coordinating manipulation, posture, and constraint tasks, and second, a set of haptic and visual human interfaces that enable intimate interaction while avoiding micromanagement. We test the presented methods in simulation and validate them in pool experiments and in two field deployments. On its maiden mission into the Mediterranean Sea, Ocean One explored the Lune, a French naval vessel that sank in 1664 off the coast of Toulon, France. In its second expedition, Ocean One assisted human divers in investigating underwater volcanic structures at Santorini, Greece.},

  abstract = {The development of autonomous vessels and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) has generated great interest in the scientific community due to their potential and advantages for use in various environments and applications. Several literature review papers have been produced from different perspectives, contributing to a better understanding of the topic and to the analysis of advances, challenges, and trends. We hypothesize that the greatest attention has been focused on the development of high-impact applications in the maritime sector. Additionally, we depart from the need to investigate the potential and advances of USVs in fluvial environments, which involve particular operating conditions, where there are different socio-environmental conditions and restrictions in terms of access to conventional energy sources and communication systems. In this sense, the main objective of this work is to study USVs in the particular context of small craft. The search for records was conducted in Scopus and Web of Science databases, covering studies published from 2000 to 16 May 2024. The methodology employed was based on the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, which is a widely recognized protocol that ensures quality and rigor in systematic reviews and bibliometric analyses. To optimize the data collection and selection process, the semaphore technique was additionally implemented, allowing for an efficient categorization of the studies found. This combined methodological approach facilitated a systematic and transparent evaluation of the literature. This study was developed based on three research questions about the evolution of research topics, areas of application, and types of algorithms related to USVs. The study of the evolution of works on USVs was carried out based on the results of the meta-analysis generated with the Bibliometrix tool. The study of applications and developments was carried out based on information obtained from the papers for six study categories: application environment, level of autonomy, application area, algorithm typology, methods, and electronic devices used. For each of the 387 papers identified in the databases, labeling was performed for the 359 screened papers with six study categories according to the availability of information in the title and abstract. In the categories application sector, autonomy level, application area and algorithm type/task, it was identified that most studies are oriented toward the maritime sector, the developments to achieve full autonomy for USVs, the development of designs or algorithms at the modeling and simulation level, and the development and implementation of algorithms for the GNC subsystems. Nevertheless, this research has revealed a much wider range of environments and applications beyond maritime, military, and commercial sectors. In addition, from the mapping of the types of algorithms used in the GNC architecture, the study provides information that can be used to guide the design of the subsystems that enable USV autonomy for civilian use in restricted environments.},

We propose Multi-View 3D networks (MV3D), a sensory-fusion framework that takes both LIDAR point cloud and RGB images as input and predicts oriented 3D bounding boxes. We encode the sparse 3D point cloud with a compact multi-view representation. The network is composed of two subnetworks: one for 3D object proposal generation and another for multi-view feature fusion. The proposal network generates 3D candidate boxes efficiently from the birds eye view representation of 3D point cloud. We design a deep fusion scheme to combine region-wise features from multiple views and enable interactions between intermediate layers of different paths. Experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by around 25\% and 30\% AP on the tasks of 3D localization and 3D detection. In addition, for 2D detection, our approach obtains 14.9\% higher AP than the state-of-the-art on the hard data among the LIDAR-based methods.},

Geometry-based fusion has shown promise for perception (e.g., object detection, motion forecasting). However, in the context of end-to-end driving, we find that imitation learning based on existing sensor fusion methods underperforms in complex driving scenarios with a high density of dynamic agents. Therefore, we propose TransFuser, a mechanism to integrate image and LiDAR representations using self-attention. Our approach uses transformer modules at multiple resolutions to fuse perspective view and bird's eye view feature maps. We experimentally validate its efficacy on a challenging new benchmark with long routes and dense traffic, as well as the official leaderboard of the CARLA urban driving simulator. At the time of submission, TransFuser outperforms all prior work on the CARLA leaderboard in terms of driving score by a large margin. Compared to geometry-based fusion, TransFuser reduces the average collisions per kilometer by 48\%.},

The technique is specifically design for unmanned systems perceiving objects that are assumed to lie on a flat surface, such as the ground, water, or sea bed. In addition to segmentation and hull extraction, the technique is shown to enable the implementation of optional processes of point filtering, object classification, mapping, and object tracking. Example GB-CACHE results are shown from four separate unmanned case studies covering three different domains (surface, aerial, underwater), using three different sensing modalities (LiDAR, radar, sonar). Dense LiDAR point clouds are then used to analyze the computational efficiency of each main processes of GB-CACHE. Collectively, GB-CACHE is shown to be efficient enough for real-time implementation even with these dense point clouds and low to mid-grade computing solutions.},

To bridge this gap and motivate future research, this article devotes to review recent deep-learning-based data fusion approaches that leverage both image and point cloud. This review gives a brief overview of deep learning on image and point cloud data processing. Followed by in-depth reviews of camera-LiDAR fusion methods in depth completion, object detection, semantic segmentation, tracking and online cross-sensor calibration, which are organized based on their respective fusion levels.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an effective object detection framework based on proposal fusion of multiple sensors such as infrared camera, RGB cameras, radar and LiDAR. Our framework first applies the Selective Search (SS) method on RGB image data to extract possible candidate proposals which likely contain the objects of interest. Then it uses the information from other sensors in order to reduce the number of generated proposals by SS and find more dense proposals. Finally, the class of objects within the final proposals are identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results on real dataset demonstrate that our framework can precisely detect meaningful object regions using a smaller number of proposals than other object proposals methods. Further, our framework can achieve reliable object detection and classification results in maritime environments.},

  abstract = {Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task for many real-world applications. In the maritime environment, this task is challenging due to varying light, view distances, weather conditions, and sea waves. In addition, light reflection, camera motion and illumination changes may cause to false detections. To address this challenge, we present three fusion architectures to fuse two imaging modalities: visible and infrared. These architectures can provide complementary information from two modalities in different levels: pixel-level, feature-level, and decision-level. They employed deep learning for performing fusion and detection. We investigate the performance of the proposed architectures conducting a real marine image dataset, which is captured by color and infrared cameras on-board a vessel in the Finnish archipelago. The cameras are employed for developing autonomous ships, and collect data in a range of operation and climatic conditions. Experiments show that feature-level fusion architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art other fusion level architectures.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in perception for autonomous driving are driven by deep learning. In order to achieve robust and accurate scene understanding, autonomous vehicles are usually equipped with different sensors (e.g. cameras, LiDARs, Radars), and multiple sensing modalities can be fused to exploit their complementary properties. In this context, many methods have been proposed for deep multi-modal perception problems. However, there is no general guideline for network architecture design, and questions of ``what to fuse'', ``when to fuse'', and ``how to fuse'' remain open. This review paper attempts to systematically summarize methodologies and discuss challenges for deep multi-modal object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To this end, we first provide an overview of on-board sensors on test vehicles, open datasets, and background information for object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving research. We then summarize the fusion methodologies and discuss challenges and open questions. In the appendix, we provide tables that summarize topics and methods. We also provide an interactive online platform to navigate each reference: https://boschresearch.github.io/multimodalperception/.},

For the best performance in sensor fusion, these different sensors must be spatially and temporally registered with respect to each other. To this end, a number of approaches have been developed to estimate these system parameters in a two stage process, first estimating the time offset and subsequently solving for the spatial transformation between sensors. In this work, we present on a novel framework for jointly estimating the temporal offset between measurements of different sensors and their spatial displacements with respect to each other. The approach is enabled by continuous-time batch estimation and extends previous work by seamlessly incorporating time offsets within the rigorous theoretical framework of maximum likelihood estimation. Experimental results for a camera to inertial measurement unit (IMU) calibration prove the ability of this framework to accurately estimate time offsets up to a fraction of the smallest measurement period.},

Most of the current approaches do not fully exploit 3D information, which has been proven to effectively improve the performance of other traditional object recognition methods.

An extensive experimentation was carried out, using ModelNet - a large-scale 3D CAD models dataset - to train and test the system, to prove that our approach is on par with state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy while being able to perform recognition under real-time constraints.},

Our recording platform is equipped with four high resolution video cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and a state-of-the-art localization system. Our benchmarks comprise 389 stereo and optical flow image pairs, stereo visual odometry sequences of 39.2 km length, and more than 200k 3D object annotations captured in cluttered scenarios (up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image). Results from state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that methods ranking high on established datasets such as Middlebury perform below average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world. Our goal is to reduce this bias by providing challenging benchmarks with novel difficulties to the computer vision community. Our benchmarks are available online at: www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti},

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30\% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3\%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features.

  abstract = {Critical research about camera-and-LiDAR-based semantic object segmentation for autonomous driving significantly benefited from the recent development of deep learning. Specifically, the vision transformer is the novel ground-breaker that successfully brought the multi-head-attention mechanism to computer vision applications. Therefore, we propose a vision-transformer-based network to carry out camera-LiDAR fusion for semantic segmentation applied to autonomous driving. Our proposal uses the novel progressive-assemble strategy of vision transformers on a double-direction network and then integrates the results in a cross-fusion strategy over the transformer decoder layers. Unlike other works in the literature, our camera-LiDAR fusion transformers have been evaluated in challenging conditions like rain and low illumination, showing robust performance. The paper reports the segmentation results over the vehicle and human classes in different modalities: camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. We perform coherent controlled benchmark experiments of CLFT against other networks that are also designed for semantic segmentation. The experiments aim to evaluate the performance of CLFT independently from two perspectives: multimodal sensor fusion and backbone architectures. The quantitative assessments show our CLFT networks yield an improvement of up to 10\% for challenging dark-wet conditions when comparing with Fully-Convolutional-Neural-Network-based (FCN) camera-LiDAR fusion neural network. Contrasting to the network with transformer backbone but using single modality input, the all-around improvement is 5-10\%.},

In this paper, we first present an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach based on the probabilistic data association method in order to achieve accurate object detection and tracking results. The proposed approach fuses the detection results obtained independently from four main sensors: radar, LiDAR, RGB camera and infrared camera. It generates object region proposals based on the fused detection result. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is used to identify the object categories within these regions. The CNN is trained on a real dataset from different ferry driving scenarios. The experimental results of tracking and classification on real datasets show that the proposed approach provides reliable object detection and classification results in maritime environments.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8{\texttimes} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

  abstract = {Multi-modal fusion is a fundamental task for the perception of an autonomous driving system, which has recently intrigued many researchers. However, achieving a rather good performance is not an easy task due to the noisy raw data, underutilized information, and the misalignment of multi-modal sensors. In this paper, we provide a literature review of the existing multi-modal-based methods for perception tasks in autonomous driving. Generally, we make a detailed analysis including over 50 papers leveraging perception sensors including LiDAR and camera trying to solve object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Different from traditional fusion methodology for categorizing fusion models, we propose an innovative way that divides them into two major classes, four minor classes by a more reasonable taxonomy in the view of the fusion stage. Moreover, we dive deep into the current fusion methods, focusing on the remaining problems and open-up discussions on the potential research opportunities.

  abstract = {Multi-modal fusion is a fundamental task for the perception of an autonomous driving system, which has recently intrigued many researchers. However, achieving a rather good performance is not an easy task due to the noisy raw data, underutilized information, and the misalignment of multi-modal sensors. In this paper, we provide a literature review of the existing multi-modal-based methods for perception tasks in autonomous driving. Generally, we make a detailed analysis including over 50 papers leveraging perception sensors including LiDAR and camera trying to solve object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Different from traditional fusion methodology for categorizing fusion models, we propose an innovative way that divides them into two major classes, four minor classes by a more reasonable taxonomy in the view of the fusion stage. Moreover, we dive deep into the current fusion methods, focusing on the remaining problems and open-up discussions on the potential research opportunities. In conclusion, what we expect to do in this paper is to present a new taxonomy of multi-modal fusion methods for the autonomous driving perception tasks and provoke thoughts of the fusion-based techniques in the future.},

  abstract = {Environment sensing plays an important role for the safe autonomous navigation of intelligent ships. However, the inherent limitations of sensors, such as the low frequency of the automatic identification system (AIS), blind zone of the marine radar, and lack of depth information in visible images, make it difficult to achieve accurate sensing with a single modality of sensor data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new multi-source data fusion framework and technologies that integrate AIS, radar, and visible data. This framework leverages the complementary strengths of these different types of sensors to enhance sensing performance, especially in real complex scenarios where single-modality data are significantly affected by blind zone and adverse weather conditions. We first design a multi-stage detection and tracking method (named MSTrack). By feeding the historical fusion results back to earlier tracking stages, the proposed method identifies and refines potential missing detections from the layered detection and tracking processes of radar and visible images. Then, a cascade association matching method is proposed to realize the association between multi-source trajectories. It first performs pairwise association in a high-accuracy aligned coordinate system, followed by association in a low-accuracy coordinate system and integrated matching between multi-source data. Through these association operations, the method can effectively reduce the association errors caused by measurement noise and projection system errors. Furthermore, we develop the first multi-source fusion dataset for intelligent vessel (WHUT-MSFVessel), and validate our methods. The experimental results show that our multi-source data fusion methods significantly improve the sensing accuracy and identity consistency of tracking, achieving average MOTA scores of 0.872 and 0.938 on the radar and visible images, respectively, and IDF1 scores of 0.811 and 0.929. Additionally, the fusion accuracy reaches up to 0.9, which can provide vessels with a comprehensive perception of the navigation environment for safer navigation.},

  abstract = {3D LiDARs and 2D cameras are increasingly being used alongside each other in sensor rigs for perception tasks. Before these sensors can be used to gather meaningful data, however, their extrinsics (and intrinsics) need to be accurately calibrated, as the performance of the sensor rig is extremely sensitive to these calibration parameters. A vast majority of existing calibration techniques require significant amounts of data and/or calibration targets and human effort, severely impacting their applicability in large-scale production systems. We address this gap with CalibNet: a self-supervised deep network capable of automatically estimating the 6-DoF rigid body transformation between a 3D LiDAR and a 2D camera in real-time. CalibNet alleviates the need for calibration targets, thereby resulting in significant savings in calibration efforts. During training, the network only takes as input a LiDAR point cloud, the corresponding monocular image, and the camera calibration matrix K. At train time, we do not impose direct supervision (i.e., we do not directly regress to the calibration parameters, for example). Instead, we train the network to predict calibration parameters that maximize the geometric and photometric consistency of the input images and point clouds. CalibNet learns to iteratively solve the underlying geometric problem and accurately predicts extrinsic calibration parameters for a wide range of mis-calibrations, without requiring retraining or domain adaptation.

In this paper, for the benchmark of DNN algorithms, we correct the annotations of the SMD dataset and present an improved version, which we coined SMD-Plus.

More specifically, an online transformation of training images via Copy \& Paste is applied to solve the class-imbalance problem in the training dataset. Furthermore, the mix-up technique is adopted in addition to the basic augmentation techniques for YOLO-V5. Experimental results show that the detection and classification performance of the modified YOLO-V5 with the SMD-Plus has improved in comparison to the original YOLO-V5.

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called ``dropout'' that proved to be very effective.

  abstract = {The fusion of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and camera data in real-time is known to be a crucial process in many applications, such as in autonomous driving, industrial automation, and robotics. Especially in the case of autonomous vehicles, the efficient fusion of data from these two types of sensors is important to enabling the depth of objects as well as the detection of objects at short and long distances. As both the sensors are capable of capturing the different attributes of the environment simultaneously, the integration of those attributes with an efficient fusion approach greatly benefits the reliable and consistent perception of the environment. This paper presents a method to estimate the distance (depth) between a self-driving car and other vehicles, objects, and signboards on its path using the accurate fusion approach. Based on the geometrical transformation and projection, low-level sensor fusion was performed between a camera and LiDAR using a 3D marker. Further, the fusion information is utilized to estimate the distance of objects detected by the RefineDet detector. Finally, the accuracy and performance of the sensor fusion and distance estimation approach were evaluated in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis by considering real road and simulation environment scenarios. Thus the proposed low-level sensor fusion, based on the computational geometric transformation and projection for object distance estimation proves to be a promising solution for enabling reliable and consistent environment perception ability for autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract = {Small maritime targets, e.g., periscope tubes, jet skies, swimmers and small boats, are potential threats for naval ships under many conditions, but are difficult to detect with current radar systems due to their limited radar cross section and the presence of sea clutter. On the other hand, applications of lidar systems have shown that the reflections from small targets are significantly stronger than reflections from the sea surface. As a result, dedicated lidar systems are potential tools for the detection of small maritime targets. A geometric approach is used to compare the diffuse reflection properties of cylinders and spheres with flat surfaces, which is used to estimate the maximum detectable range of such objects for a given lidar system. Experimental results using lasers operating at 1.06 {\textmu}m and 1.57 {\textmu}m confirm this theory and are discussed. Small buoys near Scheveningen harbor could be detected under adverse weather over more than 9 km. Extrapolation of these results indicates that small targets can be detected out to ranges of approximately 20 km.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

  abstract = {The rising frequency of ocean activities, such as ocean transportation and marine resources development, inevitably leads to a higher incidence of sudden accidents at sea. Maritime search and rescue (MSAR) plays a crucial role in marine transportation. Specifically, maritime search serves as a preparatory mission before executing the actual rescue operations. In 2018, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) made significant legal amendments to the international convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), emphasizing the critical importance of MSAR operations. Nevertheless, the conventional maritime search systems, such as independent surface ships, underwater vehicles, or aerial platforms, fall short of meeting the demands of modern shipping and can impose significant energy and economic burdens. Meanwhile, unmanned systems are gaining prominence in maritime search due to their notable advantages, including high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and rapid deployment. One observes that the research of unmanned maritime search is still in an early stage. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art of maritime unmanned search system development with four dimensions, including the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), unmanned surface vessel (USV) and underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) and its cooperative heterogeneous vehicles. Firstly, the search types, the superiorities and the application scenarios of the unmanned search system are summarized. Then, the theoretical progress, engineering applications and limitations for the unmanned search system are investigated. To further discuss the advantages of the unmanned search system, a novel cooperative platform is established that uses an USV and two UAVs. In the proposed platform, the sensor, communication, guidance and control subsystems are described to illustrate the convenience and the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative system. Finally, the future research directions are examined to expedite the practical implementation of theoretical advancements in the field of maritime unmanned search.},

Current methods rely on point clouds from the LiDAR sensor as queries to leverage the feature from the image space. However, people discovered that this underlying assumption makes the current fusion framework infeasible to produce any prediction when there is a LiDAR malfunction, regardless of minor or major. This fundamentally limits the deployment capability to realistic autonomous driving scenarios. In contrast, we propose a surprisingly simple yet novel fusion framework, dubbed BEVFusion, whose camera stream does not depend on the input of LiDAR data, thus addressing the downside of previous methods. We empirically show that our framework surpasses the state-of-the-art methods under the normal training settings. Under the robustness training settings that simulate various LiDAR malfunctions, our framework significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by 15.7\% to 28.9\% mAP. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to handle realistic LiDAR malfunction and can be deployed to realistic scenarios without any post-processing procedure.

Among the most commonly used sensors, camera provides dense semantic information but lacks accurate distance information to the target, while LiDAR provides accurate depth information but with sparse resolution. In this paper, a LiDAR-camera-based fusion algorithm is proposed to improve the above-mentioned trade-off problems by constructing a Siamese network for object detection. Raw point clouds are converted to camera planes to obtain a 2D depth image. By designing a cross feature fusion block to connect the depth and RGB processing branches, the feature-layer fusion strategy is applied to integrate multi-modality data. The proposed fusion algorithm is evaluated on the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has superior performance and real-time efficiency. Remarkably, it outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms at the most important moderate level and achieves excellent performance at the easy and hard levels.},

  abstract = {Multi-sensor fusion is essential for an accurate and reliable autonomous driving system. Recent approaches are based on point-level fusion: augmenting the LiDAR point cloud with camera features. However, the camera-to-LiDAR projection throws away the semantic density of camera features, hindering the effectiveness of such methods, especially for semantic-oriented tasks (such as 3D scene segmentation). In this paper, we propose BEVFusion, an efficient and generic multi-task multi-sensor fusion framework. It unifies multi-modal features in the shared bird's-eye view (BEV) representation space, which nicely preserves both geometric and semantic information. To achieve this, we diagnose and lift the key efficiency bottlenecks in the view transformation with optimized BEV pooling, reducing latency by more than {\textbackslash}mathbf40{\textbackslash}times. BEVFusion is fundamentally task-agnostic and seamlessly supports different 3D perception tasks with almost no architectural changes. It establishes the new state of the art on the nuScenes benchmark, achieving 1.3\% higher mAP and NDS on 3D object detection and 13.6\% higher mIoU on BEV map segmentation, with 1.9{\texttimes} lower computation cost. Code to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/bevfusion.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of water transportation, ship safety supervision is facing more severe pressures and challenges. Precise and efficient detection of ship targets is becoming more and more important, which urgently requires intelligent detection methods to ultimately improves shipping management efficiency. However, the surveillance video of waterway transportation is often influenced by fog and rain, which can affect the performance of object detection and reduce the efficiency of management. The current traditional object approaches are hard to handle these problems. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal information fusion method to handle multi-object detection in waterway transportation, which introduces the LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) dataset to add spatial information and handle the interference of fog and rain. The target ROI (Region Of Interest) point cloud and image data are initially fused in the pre-fusion stage. This phase can efficiently direct the network's attention to the region with the highest target probability, increasing the target recall rate. The 3D bounding box in the point cloud and 2D bounding boxes in the image retrieved are then fused in the post-fusion stage to improve target precision and enrich target detection information. Finally, using time synchronization and a space transformation matrix, the detection result is transferred to the picture coordinate system to create a ship image target with 3D depth information. This technique overcomes the constraints of single-sensor environment perception, adapts to the detection of ship targets in a variety of situations, and is more precise and robust. The algorithm's superiority is also demonstrated by the experiments.},

However, it has been surprisingly difficult to train networks to effectively use both modalities in a way that demonstrates gain over single-modality networks. In this paper, we propose a novel Camera-LiDAR Object Candidates (CLOCs) fusion network. CLOCs fusion provides a low-complexity multi-modal fusion framework that significantly improves the performance of single-modality detectors. CLOCs operates on the combined output candidates before Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) of any 2D and any 3D detector, and is trained to leverage their geometric and semantic consistencies to produce more accurate final 3D and 2D detection results. Our experimental evaluation on the challenging KITTI object detection benchmark, including 3D and bird's eye view metrics, shows significant improvements, especially at long distance, over the state-of-the-art fusion based methods. At time of submission, CLOCs ranks the highest among all the fusion-based methods in the official KITTI leaderboard. We will release our code upon acceptance.},

  abstract = {How should representations from complementary sensors be integrated for autonomous driving? Geometry-based sensor fusion has shown great promise for perception tasks such as object detection and motion forecasting. However, for the actual driving task, the global context of the 3D scene is key, e.g. a change in traffic light state can affect the behavior of a vehicle geometrically distant from that traffic light. Geometry alone may therefore be insufficient for effectively fusing representations in end-to-end driving models. In this work, we demonstrate that imitation learning policies based on existing sensor fusion methods under-perform in the presence of a high density of dynamic agents and complex scenarios, which require global contextual reasoning, such as handling traffic oncoming from multiple directions at uncontrolled intersections. Therefore, we propose TransFuser, a novel Multi-Modal Fusion Transformer, to integrate image and LiDAR representations using attention. We experimentally validate the efficacy of our approach in urban settings involving complex scenarios using the CARLA urban driving simulator. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art driving performance while reducing collisions by 76\% compared to geometry-based fusion.},

The electro-optical (EO) sensor considered here is a video camera that operates in the visible or the infrared spectra, which conventionally complements radar and sonar for situational awareness at sea and has demonstrated its effectiveness over the last few years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction, and foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The key processes involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background, and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation. The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime systems that use EO sensors. The survey also highlights methods from computer vision research, which hold promise to perform well in maritime EO data processing. Performance of several maritime and computer vision techniques is evaluated on Singapore Maritime Dataset.},

  abstract = {Small object detection (SOD) in optical images and videos is a challenging problem that even state-of-the-art generic object detection methods fail to accurately localize and identify such objects. Typically, small objects appear in real-world due to large camera-object distance. Because small objects occupy only a small area in the input image (e.g., less than 10\%), the information extracted from such a small area is not always rich enough to support decision making. Multidisciplinary strategies are being developed by researchers working at the interface of deep learning and computer vision to enhance the performance of SOD deep learning based methods. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of over 160 research papers published between 2017 and 2022 in order to survey this growing subject. This paper summarizes the existing literature and provide a taxonomy that illustrates the broad picture of current research. We investigate how to improve the performance of small object detection in maritime environments, where increasing performance is critical. By establishing a connection between generic and maritime SOD research, future directions have been identified. In addition, the popular datasets that have been used for SOD for generic and maritime applications are discussed, and also well-known evaluation metrics for the state-of-the-art methods on some of the datasets are provided.},

Our method does not require any human interaction and bridges the gap between classical offline and target-less online calibration approaches as it provides both a stable initial estimation as well as a continuous online correction of the extrinsic parameters. During training we randomly decalibrate our system in order to train RegNet to infer the correspondence between projected depth measurements and RGB image and finally regress the extrinsic calibration. Additionally, with an iterative execution of multiple CNNs, that are trained on different magnitudes of decalibration, our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods in terms of a mean calibration error of 0.28{$^\circ$} for the rotational and 6 cm for the translation components even for large decalibrations up to 1.5 m and 20{$^\circ$}.},

The estimated motion from inertial measurement unit (IMU) pre-integration de-skews point clouds and produces an initial guess for lidar odometry optimization. The obtained lidar odometry solution is used to estimate the bias of the IMU. To ensure high performance in real-time, we marginalize old lidar scans for pose optimization, rather than matching lidar scans to a global map. Scan-matching at a local scale instead of a global scale significantly improves the real-time performance of the system, as does the selective introduction of keyframes, and an efficient sliding window approach that registers a new keyframe to a fixed-size set of prior "sub-keyframes." The proposed method is extensively evaluated on datasets gathered from three platforms over various scales and environments.},

With the continuous development of artificial intelligence, electro-optical (EO) sensors such as video cameras are used to supplement marine radar to improve the detection of objects that produce weak radar signals and small sizes. In this study, we propose an enhanced convolutional neural network (CNN) named VarifocalNet * that improves object detection in harsh maritime environments. Specifically, the feature representation and learning ability of the VarifocalNet model are improved by using a deformable convolution module, redesigning the loss function, introducing a soft non-maximum suppression algorithm, and incorporating multi-scale prediction methods. These strategies improve the accuracy and reliability of our CNN-based detection results under complex sea conditions, such as in turbulent waves, sea fog, and water reflection. Experimental results under different maritime conditions show that our method significantly outperforms similar methods (such as SSD, YOLOv3, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN) in terms of the detection accuracy and robustness for small objects. The maritime obstacle detection results were obtained under harsh imaging conditions to demonstrate the performance of our network model.},

Our proposed method deeply integrates both 3D voxel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and PointNet-based set abstraction to learn more discriminative point cloud features. It takes advantages of efficient learning and high-quality proposals of the 3D voxel CNN and the flexible receptive fields of the PointNet-based networks. Specifically, the proposed framework summarizes the 3D scene with a 3D voxel CNN into a small set of keypoints via a novel voxel set abstraction module to save follow-up computations and also to encode representative scene features. Given the high-quality 3D proposals generated by the voxel CNN, the RoI-grid pooling is proposed to abstract proposal-specific features from the keypoints to the RoI-grid points via keypoint set abstraction with multiple receptive fields. Compared with conventional pooling operations, the RoI-grid feature points encode much richer context information for accurately estimating object confidences and locations. Extensive experiments on both the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open dataset show that our proposed PV-RCNN surpasses state-of-the-art 3D detection methods with remarkable margins by using only point clouds.

One such scenario is autonomous mooring, where the ship has to be tied to a fixed rigid structure (bollard) to keep it stationary safely. The detection and pose estimation of the bollard based on data fusion from the camera and LiDAR are presented here. Firstly, a single shot extrinsic calibration of LiDAR with the camera is presented. Secondly, the camera-LiDAR data fusion method using camera intrinsic parameters and camera to LiDAR extrinsic parameters is proposed. Finally, the use of an image-based segmentation method to segment the corresponding point cloud from the fused camera-LiDAR data is developed and tailored for its application in autonomous mooring operation.},

In this paper, we systematically study neural network architecture design choices for object detection and propose several key optimizations to improve efficiency. First, we propose a weighted bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN), which allows easy and fast multiscale feature fusion; Second, we propose a compound scaling method that uniformly scales the resolution, depth, and width for all backbone, feature network, and box/class prediction networks at the same time. Based on these optimizations and better backbones, we have developed a new family of object detectors, called EfficientDet, which consistently achieve much better efficiency than prior art across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. In particular, with single model and single-scale, our EfficientDet-D7 achieves state-of-the-art 55.1 AP on COCO test-dev with 77M parameters and 410B FLOPs, being 4x - 9x smaller and using 13x - 42x fewer FLOPs than previous detectors.

To enable large-scale mapping of objects, a region around the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is defined where a high density of LiDAR returns is expected, termed the visibility horizon. The polygon intersection between the visibility horizon and the newly detected objects is computed, as well as the polygon subtraction of the visibility horizon from the mapped list of polygons. The two polygon lists are then combined using a polygon union operation, with the objects retaining class designations. The result is a 2-D map that contains polygon representations of objects, where the object is described with a tunable number of vertices and may have an associated object class. Thus, providing necessary information for path planning and tasking. The resultant polygons are shown here to be accurate to 20 cm using a 10-cm occupancy grid and 16-ft-long unmanned surface vehicles with four multibeam LiDAR sensors.},

These cars have also mounted camera systems calibrated with LiDAR sensors. These camera systems have multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view which totally cover 360{$^\circ$}. In this research, we focus on 3D Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation frameworks adopting sensor fusion technologies specifically camera-LiDAR and LiDAR-only frameworks. Also, how the camera view helps LiDAR point cloud is discussed. Early fusion approach by fusing point cloud and pseudo-LiDAR in the early step before the object detection network is experimented within the implementation. The depth map is generated from a single camera view. Depth map from front-view camera image which has forward direction information is adopted in this experiment while merging multi-camera images and merging depth maps are discussed at the same time. Pseudo-LiDAR is generated from a depth map while encountering distortion problems due to an unknown depth shift. To overcome this problem and find exact metric reconstruction, some possible solutions are offered. One possible solution is that pseudo-LiDAR uses a 3D point cloud to learn this unknown depth shift. To align two 3D point clouds, one original and one virtual, into one common base, ground extracted from both point clouds. Pandaset [1] which has 360{$^\circ$} and forward-facing LiDAR point cloud and multi-view images is exploited as an autonomous driving dataset.--Author's abstract},

TLR is important for autonomous vehicles because running against a red light could cause a deadly car accident. For a practical TLR system, computation time, varying illumination conditions, and false positives are three key challenges. In this paper, a novel real-time method is proposed to recognize a traffic light with high dynamic imaging and deep learning. In our approach, traffic light candidates are robustly detected from low exposure/dark frames and accurately classified using a deep neural network in consecutive high exposure/bright frames. This dual-channel mechanism can make full use of undistorted color and shape information in dark frames as well as the rich context in bright frames. In the dark channel, a non-parametric multi-color saliency model is proposed to simultaneously extract lights with different colors. A multiclass classifier with convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then adopted to reduce the number of false positives in the bright channel. The performance is further boosted by incorporating temporal trajectory tracking. In order to speed up the algorithm, a prior detection mask is generated to limit the potential search regions. Intensive experiments on a large dual-channel dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time deep learning object detector, which could cause more false positives because it uses bright images only. The algorithm has been integrated into our autonomous vehicle and can work robustly on real roads.},

The performance of conventional sensors and the necessity of multi-sensor fusion are analyzed, including radar, LiDAR, camera, ultrasonic, GPS, IMU, and V2X. According to the differences in the latest studies, we divide the fusion strategies into four categories and point out some shortcomings. Sensor fusion is mainly applied for multi-target tracking and environment reconstruction. We discuss the method of establishing a motion model and data association in multi-target tracking. At the end of the paper, we analyzed the deficiencies in the current studies and put forward some suggestions for further improvement in the future. Through this investigation, we hope to analyze the current situation of multi-sensor fusion in the automated driving process and provide more efficient and reliable fusion strategies.},

Hence, the focus on using Stereo-cameras and LiDARs as a complement to its accurate distance measurement. However, the calibration process of the sensors is mandatory before deployment. Some may use the conventional methods, including checkerboards, specific pattern labels, or even human labeling, which is labor-intensive and repetitive as it involves doing the same calibration process every time before using. In this work, we have proposed NetCalib -- an auto-calibration methodology based on a deep neural network. This research aims to utilize the power of machine learning to find the geometric transformation between stereo cameras and LiDAR automatically. From the experiments, our method manages to find the transformations from randomly sampled artificial errors and outperforms the linear optimization-based ICP algorithm.

An effective representation learning and fusion of such multi-modal sensor data is necessary and critical for better 3D object detection performance. To solve the problem, in this paper, we will introduce a novel vision transformer-based 3D object detection model, namely FusionViT. Different from the existing 3D object detection approaches, FusionViT is a pure-ViT based framework, which adopts a hierarchical architecture by extending the transformer model to embed both images and point clouds for effective representation learning. Such multi-modal data embedding representations will be further fused together via a fusion vision transformer model prior to feeding the learned features to the object detection head for both detection and localization of the 3D objects in the input scenery. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FusionViT, extensive experiments have been done on real-world traffic object detection benchmark datasets KITTI and Waymo Open. Notably, our FusionViT model can achieve state-of-the-art performance and outperforms not only the existing baseline methods that merely rely on camera images or lidar point clouds, but also the latest multi-modal image-point cloud deep fusion approaches.},

  abstract = {The fusion of LiDARs and cameras has been increasingly adopted in autonomous driving for perception tasks. The performance of such fusion-based algorithms largely depends on the accuracy of sensor calibration, which is challenging due to the difficulty of identifying common features across different data modalities. Previously, many calibration methods involved specific targets and/or manual intervention, which has proven to be cumbersome and costly. Learning-based online calibration methods have been proposed, but their performance is barely satisfactory in most cases. These methods usually suffer from issues such as sparse feature maps, unreliable cross-modality association, inaccurate calibration parameter regression, etc. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose CalibFormer, an end-to-end network for automatic LiDAR-camera calibration. We aggregate multiple layers of camera and LiDAR image features to achieve high-resolution representations. A multi-head correlation module is utilized to identify correlations between features more accurately. Lastly, we employ transformer architectures to estimate accurate calibration parameters from the correlation information. Our method achieved a mean translation error of \$0.8751 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}\$ and a mean rotation error of \$0.0562 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ on the KITTI dataset, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating strong robustness, accuracy, and generalization capabilities.},

Most existing methods for ship detection rely on camera-based methods, which are sensitive to environmental conditions and cannot directly provide spatial location information related to detected targets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a LiDAR-based ship detection and tracking framework that can be applied to busy maritime environments. The proposed framework consists of two functional modules: a ship detection and multi-object tracking. For ship detection, a modularised network structure was adapted, allowing for ease of switching between different types of detection network to prioritise either detection accuracy, detection speed or a compromise of both, depending on the task requirements. A Kalman Filter-based multi-object tracking method is also implemented to compensate for any detections that may have been missed as a result of ship motions or occlusions, relying solely on the detection results. We also collected the first-ever real-world LiDAR dataset for maritime applications across the River Thames and marinas, including a range of ship types, with lengths ranging from 5 m up to 40 m, and different hull types. The datasets are organised in a similar manner to the KITTI datasets, which can be easily applied to the well-developed point cloud detection networks. Remarkably, our methods achieve an overall detection accuracy of 74.1\% in the collected datasets. The proposed framework and dataset make LiDAR-based environmental perception feasible for implementation in ASVs and support development in the autonomous maritime navigation field.},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable perception systems are essential for autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, 3D object detection with multi-sensors is necessary. Existing 3D detectors have significantly improved accuracy by adopting a two-stage paradigm that relies solely on LiDAR point clouds for 3D proposal refinement. However, the sparsity of point clouds, particularly for faraway points, makes it difficult for the LiDAR-only refinement module to recognize and locate objects accurately. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-modality two-stage approach called FusionRCNN. This approach effectively and efficiently fuses point clouds and camera images in the Regions of Interest (RoI). The FusionRCNN adaptively integrates both sparse geometry information from LiDAR and dense texture information from the camera in a unified attention mechanism. Specifically, FusionRCNN first utilizes RoIPooling to obtain an image set with a unified size and gets the point set by sampling raw points within proposals in the RoI extraction step. Then, it leverages an intra-modality self-attention to enhance the domain-specific features, followed by a well-designed cross-attention to fuse the information from two modalities. FusionRCNN is fundamentally plug-and-play and supports different one-stage methods with almost no architectural changes. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performances of popular detectors. Remarkably, FusionRCNN improves the strong SECOND baseline by 6.14\% mAP on Waymo and outperforms competing two-stage approaches.},

In the beginning, the ISMOD metrics based on the RGB camera is analyzed from three significant aspects, namely accuracy, speed, and robustness. Subsequently, the latest research status and comparative overview are presented, encompassing three mainstream detection methods: traditional detection, deep learning detection, and sensor fusion detection. Finally, the existing challenges of ISMOD are discussed and future development trends are recommended.

  abstract = {The article presents a comprehensive summary of Intelligent Ship Marine Object Detection (ISMOD) based on the RGB Camera. Marine object detection plays a pivotal role in enabling intelligent ships to acquire crucial data and security assurances for autonomous navigation. Among the various detection sensors, the RGB Camera is an informative and cost-effective tool with a wide range of civil applications. In the beginning, the ISMOD metrics based on the RGB camera is analyzed from three significant aspects, namely accuracy, speed, and robustness. Subsequently, the latest research status and comparative overview are presented, encompassing three mainstream detection methods: traditional detection, deep learning detection, and sensor fusion detection. Finally, the existing challenges of ISMOD are discussed and future development trends are recommended. The results demonstrate that forthcoming development will predominantly concentrate on deep learning approaches, complemented by other techniques. It is imperative to advance detection performance in domains such as deep fusion, multi-feature extraction, multi-fusion technology, and lightweight detection architecture.},

  abstract = {Accurate LiDAR-camera online calibration is critical for modern autonomous vehicles and robot platforms. Dominant methods heavily rely on hand-crafted features, which are not scalable in practice. With the increasing popularity of deep learning (DL), a few recent efforts have demonstrated the advantages of DL for feature extraction on this task. However, their reported performances are not sufficiently satisfying yet. We believe one improvement can be the problem formulation with proper consideration of the underneath geometry. Besides, existing online calibration methods focus on optimizing the calibration error while overlooking the tolerance within the error bounds. To address the research gap, a DL-based LiDAR-camera calibration method, named as the RGGNet, is proposed by considering the Riemannian geometry and utilizing a deep generative model to learn an implicit tolerance model. When evaluated on KITTI benchmark datasets, the proposed method demonstrates superior performances to the state-of-the-art DL-based methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/KleinYuan/RGGNet.},

The fundamental task of maritime transportation surveillance and autonomous ship navigation is to construct a reachable visual perception system that requires high efficiency and high accuracy of marine object detection. Therefore, high-performance deep learning-based algorithms and high-quality marine-related datasets need to be summarized. This survey focuses on summarizing the methods and application scenarios of maritime object detection, analyzes the characteristics of different marine-related datasets, highlights the marine detection application of the YOLO series model, and also discusses the current limitations of object detection based on deep learning and possible breakthrough directions. The large-scale, multiscenario industrialized neural network training is an indispensable link to solve the practical application of marine object detection. A widely accepted and standardized large-scale marine object verification dataset should be proposed.},

  abstract = {An improved maritime object detection algorithm, SRC-YOLO, based on the YOLOv4-tiny, is proposed in the foggy environment to address the issues of false detection, missed detection, and low detection accuracy in complicated situations. To confirm the model's validity, an ocean dataset containing various concentrations of haze, target angles, and sizes was produced for the research. Firstly, the Single Scale Retinex (SSR) algorithm was applied to preprocess the dataset to reduce the interference of the complex scenes on the ocean. Secondly, in order to increase the model's receptive field, we employed a modified Receptive Field Block (RFB) module in place of the standard convolution in the Neck part of the model. Finally, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which integrates channel and spatial information, was introduced to raise detection performance by expanding the network model's attention to the context information in the feature map and the object location points. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved SRC-YOLO model effectively detects marine targets in foggy scenes by increasing the mean Average Precision (mAP) of detection results from 79.56\% to 86.15\%.},

  abstract = {Accurate detection of objects in 3D point clouds is a central problem in many applications, such as autonomous navigation, housekeeping robots, and augmented/virtual reality. To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) technology has prevailed in a wide range of applications, such as autonomous driving, intelligent robots, Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR). Multi-sensor fusion using the most popular three types of sensors (e.g., visual sensor, LiDAR sensor, and IMU) is becoming ubiquitous in SLAM, in part because of the complementary sensing capabilities and the inevitable shortages (e.g., low precision and long-term drift) of the stand-alone sensor in challenging environments. In this article, we survey thoroughly the research efforts taken in this field and strive to provide a concise but complete review of the related work. Firstly, a brief introduction of the state estimator formation in SLAM is presented. Secondly, the state-of-the-art algorithms of different multi-sensor fusion algorithms are given. Then we analyze the deficiencies associated with the reviewed approaches and formulate some future research considerations. This paper can be considered as a brief guide to newcomers and a comprehensive reference for experienced researchers and engineers to explore new interesting orientations.},
