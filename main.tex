\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Significance of Study}

The development of \acp{ASV} represents a significant technological advancement requiring sophisticated perception systems capable of detecting and classifying maritime objects with high accuracy and reliability in real-time operational environments. As \ac{ASV} technology advances toward practical deployment in commercial and research applications, understanding the comparative performance characteristics of different sensing modalities and their integration through sensor fusion methodologies becomes critical for effective system design and operational safety assurance.

The advancement of autonomous surface vessel technology has gained significant momentum through comprehensive research programs and competitive evaluation platforms such as the Maritime RobotX Challenge, where multidisciplinary teams develop and test \ac{ASV} platforms under realistic maritime operational conditions. These research platforms serve as essential testbeds for evaluating perception technologies under actual environmental constraints, providing valuable empirical insights into sensor performance characteristics, real-time processing capabilities, and complex system integration challenges that cannot be adequately assessed through simulation alone.

Research platforms provide critical opportunities for real-world validation of perception algorithms under actual maritime conditions with operational time constraints. These platforms enable comprehensive comparative analysis opportunities for evaluating different sensor modalities and advanced sensor fusion approaches under controlled yet realistic testing scenarios. Furthermore, research platforms facilitate essential technology transfer pathways from experimental research systems to operational \ac{ASV} deployments requiring robust real-time performance guarantees. Finally, these platforms enable systematic performance benchmarking that supports rigorous evaluation of detection accuracy, classification reliability, and sensor fusion effectiveness across diverse maritime operational scenarios.

Current \ac{ASV} development faces a significant knowledge gap regarding the quantitative performance characteristics of different sensing modalities and their integration methodologies in complex maritime environments. While individual sensor technologies, particularly \ac{LiDAR} systems and vision-based cameras, have been extensively studied and validated in terrestrial applications, their comparative performance characteristics and sensor fusion integration capabilities in maritime contexts lack systematic quantitative analysis with emphasis on real-time processing constraints and computational efficiency requirements.

Comprehensive performance analysis requires systematic detection accuracy comparison between \ac{LiDAR}-based systems utilizing \ac{GB-CACHE} processing and vision-based systems implementing \ac{YOLO} object detection algorithms. Additionally, rigorous classification performance evaluation across diverse maritime object types using advanced machine learning algorithms must be conducted to establish performance baselines. Assessment of training requirements for machine learning-based classification systems, particularly focusing on data efficiency and convergence characteristics, represents another critical analytical requirement. Real-time processing capabilities and computational efficiency evaluation under operational constraints must be systematically analyzed to ensure practical deployment feasibility. Moreover, sensor fusion effectiveness evaluation, specifically examining bounding box confidence integration methodologies, requires comprehensive analysis to determine optimal multi-modal processing approaches. Finally, environmental robustness evaluation across varying maritime conditions, including different weather states, lighting conditions, and sea states, must be conducted to ensure reliable operational performance.

\ac{ASV} perception systems must reliably detect and classify a diverse range of maritime objects that are critical for safe autonomous navigation, requiring robust algorithms capable of real-time processing under challenging environmental conditions. The maritime environment presents unique detection challenges due to varying lighting conditions, wave-induced platform motion, and the diverse physical characteristics of navigation-critical objects that must be accurately identified and classified. Navigation buoys, including Polyform A-2 and A-3 buoys available in various colors for channel marking and navigation guidance, represent primary detection targets requiring high accuracy classification. Regulatory markers, specifically Sur-Mark tall buoys designed for navigation reference and hazard identification, present distinct detection challenges due to their geometric characteristics and operational deployment contexts. Light towers serving as active navigation aids provide both visual and electronic guidance signals, requiring detection algorithms capable of handling variable illumination and signaling states. Various vessels, including recreational boats and commercial watercraft, represent dynamic detection targets with diverse size, shape, and motion characteristics that complicate reliable classification. Maritime infrastructure elements, including docks, piers, and other fixed navigational hazards, require robust detection capabilities to ensure safe autonomous navigation in complex harbor and coastal environments.

% \subsection{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Problem Statement: Performance Comparison Gap}

Despite the growing operational importance of autonomous surface vessels and the significant maturation of individual sensor technologies over the past decade, there exists a critical and well-documented gap in quantitative performance comparison between different sensing modalities specifically applied to maritime object detection and classification tasks. Current \ac{ASV} development efforts lack systematic analytical frameworks for evaluating how \ac{LiDAR}-based systems utilizing advanced point cloud processing algorithms perform relative to vision-based systems implementing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches when deployed in realistic maritime operational environments.

Existing research efforts in maritime object detection and classification have primarily focused on individual sensor implementations and algorithm development without conducting comprehensive comparative analysis that would inform optimal sensor selection and integration strategies for operational \ac{ASV} systems. Contemporary research demonstrates a predominant focus on \ac{LiDAR}-only implementations that emphasize point cloud processing methodologies and clustering algorithms specifically adapted for maritime environments, yet these studies typically lack comparative evaluation against alternative sensing modalities. Similarly, vision-only system research emphasizes deep learning approaches for maritime object recognition, particularly convolutional neural network architectures, but generally operates in isolation without systematic comparison to \ac{LiDAR}-based approaches. The limited cross-modal comparison studies that do exist provide insufficient quantitative performance metrics and lack standardized evaluation frameworks necessary for meaningful comparative analysis. Furthermore, there exists a notable absence of standardized evaluation frameworks specifically designed for maritime perception systems, hindering systematic comparison and technology advancement across research groups and commercial developers.

The absence of comprehensive quantitative performance analysis leaves fundamental technical and operational questions unanswered for \ac{ASV} system designers and engineers responsible for developing reliable autonomous navigation systems. Critical questions regarding detection and classification performance remain inadequately addressed in current research literature. Specifically, the comparative detection accuracy performance of \ac{LiDAR}-based systems utilizing \ac{GB-CACHE} processing versus vision-based systems implementing \ac{YOLO} algorithms for specific maritime object types requires systematic investigation. The precision and recall characteristics of each sensing modality across different object classes under varying environmental conditions need quantitative evaluation to inform sensor selection decisions. Training requirements, including data volume, computational resources, and convergence time, differ significantly between \ac{LiDAR} feature-based approaches and vision-based deep learning methodologies, yet these differences lack systematic quantification. Computational overhead associated with each sensing modality for real-time operation, including processing latency and resource utilization, requires comprehensive analysis to ensure practical deployment feasibility. Additionally, the effectiveness of sensor fusion methodologies, particularly bounding box confidence integration approaches, needs rigorous evaluation to determine optimal multi-modal processing strategies for enhanced detection performance.

% \subsection{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Problem Statement: Sensor Fusion Challenges}

Autonomous surface vessels require precise integration of multiple sensing modalities to achieve reliable object detection and classification performance that meets operational safety standards for autonomous navigation. A fundamental and persistent challenge in \ac{ASV} perception system development lies in establishing and maintaining accurate spatial and temporal calibration between \ac{LiDAR} and camera systems under dynamic maritime operational conditions that present unique environmental challenges not encountered in terrestrial applications.

Multi-sensor \ac{ASV} platforms face unique spatial calibration requirements that differ significantly from terrestrial applications due to the dynamic nature of maritime environments and the continuous mechanical stresses imposed by marine operational conditions. Environmental factors affecting calibration present ongoing challenges for maintaining sensor alignment accuracy. Platform motion induced by wave action creates continuous roll, pitch, and yaw movements that affect sensor alignment and require robust calibration maintenance strategies. Vibration and mechanical stress inherent in marine environments cause gradual calibration drift that can degrade sensor fusion performance over extended operational periods. Temperature variations in maritime environments affect sensor mounting structures and optical characteristics, potentially introducing systematic calibration errors that must be compensated through adaptive calibration procedures. Saltwater corrosion presents long-term challenges by potentially altering sensor mounting hardware characteristics over extended deployment periods, requiring regular calibration validation and maintenance protocols.

Precision requirements for effective sensor fusion establish demanding performance specifications for calibration maintenance systems that must operate reliably under dynamic maritime conditions. Sub-pixel accuracy calibration is essential for accurate \ac{LiDAR} point cloud projection onto camera images, enabling effective correlation between sensor modalities for object detection applications and ensuring that spatial relationships between sensors remain consistent across operational scenarios. Millimeter-level precision in spatial calibration is required for effective object detection correlation between \ac{LiDAR} and vision systems, particularly for small maritime objects such as navigation buoys where detection accuracy directly impacts navigation safety. Consistent calibration maintenance across varying operational conditions, including different sea states and weather conditions, requires robust calibration validation procedures that can adapt to changing environmental parameters. Real-time calibration validation capabilities are necessary for detecting calibration degradation during operation and implementing corrective measures to maintain sensor fusion performance without interrupting autonomous navigation operations.

\subsection{Limitations and Assumptions}

This research investigation is conducted using \ac{ERAU}'s Minion \ac{ASV} research platform and utilizes sensor data collected during the 2024 Maritime RobotX Challenge competition, which establishes specific operational and methodological constraints that define the scope and applicability of research findings.

Platform-specific limitations inherent in this research approach must be acknowledged and considered when interpreting results and their broader applicability. Research findings are specifically applicable to \ac{ERAU}'s Minion research platform design, including its particular sensor mounting configuration, platform dynamics characteristics, and operational capabilities, which may not directly translate to other \ac{ASV} platform designs. The competition environment context, where primary data collection occurred during RobotX challenge events, may not represent the full spectrum of maritime operational conditions encountered in commercial or military \ac{ASV} deployments. Geographic constraints imposed by conducting testing in competition and training areas introduce environmental characteristics that may not be representative of other maritime operational regions. Operational scenarios focused on RobotX challenge tasks may not encompass the complete range of potential \ac{ASV} mission requirements and environmental conditions encountered in practical autonomous vessel operations.

This research focuses on specific maritime object categories that are relevant to RobotX competition scenarios and representative of typical \ac{ASV} navigation challenges, while acknowledging that maritime environments contain additional object types not addressed in this investigation. The research addresses six primary object classes that represent critical navigation elements in maritime environments. Tall buoys, specifically Sur-Mark regulatory buoys with standardized dimensions of 39-inch height, 10-inch column diameter, and 18-inch ring diameter, represent regulatory navigation markers requiring reliable detection and classification. Polyform A-2 buoys, measuring 14.5 inches by 19.5 inches and available in red, green, blue, and black color variants, serve as channel markers and navigation references requiring color-specific classification capabilities. Polyform A-3 buoys, with dimensions of 17 inches by 23 inches and identical color availability, represent larger navigation buoys requiring robust detection across varying distances and environmental conditions. Light towers function as active navigation aids incorporating electronic and visual signaling capabilities, presenting detection challenges due to variable illumination states and complex geometric structures. Jon boats, characterized as flat-bottom chase boats utilized in competition and training scenarios, represent small vessel detection targets with distinct geometric and motion characteristics. Sailboats, including recreational sailing vessels commonly encountered in competition environments, represent larger vessel detection targets with variable configuration due to sail and rigging arrangements.

\chapter{Review of the Relevant Literature}

% Note: All in-text citations should appear as \cite{einstein}

\acp{USV} have emerged as essential platforms capable of performing dangerous, dirty, and cumbersome tasks that exceed human capability. These vessels are pivotal in various maritime operations, including environmental monitoring, search and rescue missions, and resource exploration \cite{liebergall, eckstein2024}.% [1], [2]. 
Their ability to operate independently with minimal human intervention has significantly enhanced operational efficiency and safety at sea \cite{bai2022}.%[3].

Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings but primarily rely on some combination of visual information through a camera and spatial data provided by \ac{LiDAR} \cite{yeong2021}.%[4].
Each sensing modality offers distinct advantages: visual data provides rich color and texture information, while \ac{LiDAR} delivers precise spatial measurements of the surrounding environment.
Real-time object detection methods have been developed for both sensing modalities, leveraging deep learning architectures.
Object detection with visual data often employs transfer learning on pre-trained convolutional neural networks such as ResNet \cite{he2016} and \ac{YOLO} \cite{ultralytics}.%[6].
Similarly, \ac{LiDAR}-based object detection can be performed using point-based algorithms like PointNet \cite{garcia-garcia2016}, voxel-based methods such as VoxelNet \cite{zhou2018a}, or hybrid approaches like PV-RCNN \cite{shi2021}.%[9].
Despite these advancements, each modality has inherent limitations—vision-based systems struggle with poor lighting conditions and occlusions, while \ac{LiDAR} data can be sparse and affected by water reflections.

To address these limitations, sensor fusion techniques have been explored as a means of combining the strengths of both modalities. 
Research into sensor fusion methods dates back to military applications in the 1980s and has gained significant traction in the last 15 years, particularly due to interest from the automotive industry in autonomous driving technologies. However, no unified approach has been established for optimal sensor fusion, with ongoing debates regarding the best fusion strategies (e.g., early, mid, or late fusion) and their trade-offs concerning computational efficiency and accuracy.

While research in the automotive sector has contributed significantly to sensor fusion methodologies \cite{yeong2021,clunie2021,roriz2022,cui2022,das2022,liu2023a}, direct application to maritime environments remains challenging due to fundamental environmental differences. 
Automotive environments are highly structured, with well-defined lanes, uniform object classes, and relatively predictable lighting conditions. 
In contrast, the maritime environment introduces additional complexities, including dynamic vehicle motion induced by wind and waves, variable scene density (ranging from sparse open waters to congested littoral zones), and specular reflections on the water surface that can interfere with both vision-based \cite{liu2023a} and \ac{LiDAR}-based object detection \cite{ahmed2024}.%[15]. 
These factors necessitate domain-specific adaptations of sensor fusion architectures to ensure robust real-time object detection for \acp{USV}. 
However, the lack of available maritime-specific datasets \cite{jun-hwa2022,su2023,thompson2023} creates an additional challenge.

Given these challenges, further research is needed to enhance sensor fusion methodologies for maritime applications. 
Key areas of investigation include efficient feature selection tailored to maritime object classes, the development of lightweight fusion architectures suited for real-time processing, and an evaluation of computational requirements for deployment on \ac{USV} hardware. 
Addressing these research gaps will contribute to the advancement of autonomous maritime perception, enhancing the operational capabilities of \acp{USV} in complex and dynamic environments.

\chapter{Sensing Platform}

    \section{USV Platform}

        \subsection{Sensors}
        
            \subsubsection{Perception Geometry}

The Minion autonomous surface vessel features a comprehensive multi-modal sensor suite designed to support comparative analysis of object detection performance across sensing modalities.
The platform integrates both omnidirectional situational awareness sensors and forward-facing perception sensors optimized for sensor fusion research.

The Minion sensor configuration includes 360-degree \ac{LiDAR} coverage provided by three Velodyne HDL-32E units positioned to deliver complete omnidirectional point cloud coverage of the vessel's operating environment.
A forward-facing perception array comprises three Livox Horizon \ac{LiDAR} units paired with six cameras, providing high-density returns and visual data in a 165-degree forward field of view.
Visual sensing modalities include three 4K FLIR cameras, two \ac{LWIR} thermal cameras, and one \ac{HDR} camera.
A Pinpoint \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} system provides both global time synchronization and platform pose estimation.

The sensor coordinate frames are organized in a hierarchical transformation tree structure.
The inertial reference frame (\texttt{map}) defines the world-fixed coordinate system based on \ac{GPS}.
The platform reference frame (\texttt{base\_link}) represents the vessel body frame defined by the Pinpoint \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS}.
The center Livox frame (\texttt{livox\_center}) serves as the primary \ac{LiDAR} reference, with the port Livox frame (\texttt{livox\_port}) and starboard Livox frame (\texttt{livox\_starboard}) as child frames.
Six camera image frames exist within this tree, with \texttt{hdr\_camera\_frame} serving as the primary camera for fusion research.
Intrinsic calibration parameters including camera matrices and distortion coefficients, along with extrinsic transformation parameters relating sensor frames to each other and to the platform frame, are discussed in Section 3.2.1.

While the Velodyne sensors provide comprehensive 360-degree environmental awareness for navigation and collision avoidance, the forward-facing Livox Horizon \ac{LiDAR} units were selected specifically for sensor fusion research due to their superior point cloud density within the camera field of view.
The three Livox units concentrate sampling density in the forward 165-degree field of view, matching the horizontal coverage of the three 4K FLIR cameras.
Each Livox Horizon features an 81.7° × 25.1° (horizontal × vertical) field of view.
The overlapping deployment ensures higher uniform point density across the 165-degree forward perception envelope.

The Livox scan pattern employs a non-repetitive rosette pattern that progressively covers the field of view over time rather than repeatedly sampling fixed positions.
This characteristic enables temporal aggregation to increase effective spatial resolution, particularly beneficial for a moving platform where \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} pose data enables motion-compensated point cloud accumulation.

The dual \ac{LiDAR} architecture serves complementary purposes.
The Velodyne HDL-32E units provide the omnidirectional awareness required for autonomous navigation, while the Livox Horizon sensors optimize point cloud density specifically within the forward camera field of view for fusion research.
This configuration enables comparative evaluation of detection performance while maintaining operational navigation capabilities.
The sensor suite supports the research objectives of comparing detection performance across modalities and evaluating late fusion approaches.
The following subsections detail individual sensor specifications and selection rationale.

            \subsubsection{Camera Systems}

The Minion platform features six cameras providing visual perception across multiple sensing modalities.
The camera suite comprises three 4K FLIR cameras arranged to provide overlapping forward coverage extending to 165 degrees horizontal field of view, with one camera facing directly forward and the other two positioned with overlapping fields of view to extend lateral coverage.
Two \ac{LWIR} thermal cameras provide overlapping 165-degree forward field of view for thermal imaging capability.
One Leopard Imaging IMX490 \ac{HDR} camera offers forward-facing high dynamic range imaging with 65-degree horizontal field of view.

The Leopard Imaging LI-USB30-IMX490-GW5400-GMSL2-065H \ac{HDR} camera was selected as the primary visual sensor for \ac{LiDAR}-camera fusion research.
This selection was based on several factors including the camera's capability to handle challenging maritime lighting conditions and results from preliminary comparative studies.
Early testing conducted by Liebergall et al. \cite{liebergall} compared YOLO-based object detection performance between the \ac{HDR} camera and the 4K FLIR cameras aboard Minion.
Although the final results of this comparative study were published after the dataset for this research had been collected, the preliminary findings supported the \ac{HDR} camera selection for fusion experiments.

The \ac{HDR} camera addresses high-contrast scenes characteristic of maritime environments, where bright sky, reflective water surfaces, and shadowed objects appear simultaneously.
Extended dynamic range preserves visual detail across the broad luminance spectrum encountered in these conditions \cite{thompson2023}.

The Leopard Imaging IMX490 incorporates Sony's automotive-grade image sensor, originally designed for advanced driver assistance systems facing similar environmental challenges.
Table 3.1 presents the camera's key specifications.

\begin{table}[h]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:hdr_camera_specs}
\end{table}

The 2880×1860 resolution provides sufficient spatial detail for detecting objects at relevant ranges in autonomous vessel navigation, while the 25 fps frame rate adequately supports typical vessel speeds and maneuvering.

The camera interface architecture, software integration, GStreamer pipeline implementation, and timestamp synchronization infrastructure are discussed in detail in the video pipeline section.

The maritime environment influenced both camera selection and deployment approach.
The \ac{HDR} capability addresses extreme brightness differences between sky, water, and shadowed structures, while the automotive-grade sensor provides environmental sealing and a temperature range suitable for outdoor operation.
The USB 3.0 interface enables placement of the camera in weatherproof housing separate from the computing hardware, with the specification supporting cable runs up to 5 meters.
The three cameras are mounted in individual weatherproof boxes integrated into the camera enclosure assembly described in Section 3.1.2.2, which manages power distribution, environmental protection, and network connectivity while preserving the required geometric relationships.

The IMX490's native \ac{HDR} combines multiple exposures in a single frame period, achieving 120 dB dynamic range without sequential multi-exposure capture.
This simultaneous approach eliminates motion artifacts associated with temporal bracketing, which is critical when both the platform and targets are in motion.
Image quality validation and intrinsic calibration are addressed in Section 3.2.1.1, including lens distortion characterization and camera matrix estimation.
The combination of wide dynamic range, moderate resolution, and calibrated geometry provides the image quality necessary for training and evaluating vision-based detection models in Chapter 5.

Thompson et al. \cite{thompson2023} originally developed this camera hardware and integration approach, establishing a foundation for maritime perception research.
The primary enhancement introduced in this work comprises in-band timestamp embedding and temporal drift correction detailed in Section 3.2.2, which are essential for rigorous multi-modal sensor fusion analysis.

            \subsubsection{LiDAR Systems}

The Minion platform features six \ac{LiDAR} units providing both omnidirectional environmental awareness and forward-facing high-density perception.
The \ac{LiDAR} suite comprises three Velodyne HDL-32E units and three Livox Horizon units.

The three Velodyne HDL-32E mechanically rotating 360-degree \ac{LiDAR} sensors are positioned to provide complete omnidirectional point cloud coverage.
One unit is positioned at aft-center, with the other two placed at approximately one-third intervals around the vessel at forward-port and forward-starboard locations to achieve full 360-degree field of view coverage.

The three Livox Horizon solid-state forward-scanning \ac{LiDAR} sensors provide high-density returns within a 165-degree forward field of view matching the camera array coverage.
These sensors were selected specifically for \ac{LiDAR}-camera fusion research based on superior point cloud density within the camera field of view and a non-repetitive scan pattern that enhances coverage through temporal aggregation \cite{thompson2023}.

Initial planning considered utilizing the Velodyne HDL-32E sensors already installed on the Minion platform for fusion research.
However, analysis of point cloud density within the camera field of view revealed fundamental limitations of mechanically rotating \ac{LiDAR} for sensor fusion applications.
Traditional spinning sensors like the Velodyne HDL-32E employ a fixed vertical array of laser emitters that rotates horizontally at constant speed.
The HDL-32E incorporates 32 laser channels arranged vertically across approximately 40 degrees of elevation.
This array rotates at 10 Hz, producing 32 discrete horizontal rings of returns distributed across the full 360-degree plane \cite{thompson2023}.

While 360-degree coverage provides comprehensive spatial awareness, it presents challenges for camera-\ac{LiDAR} fusion.
First, sparse azimuthal sampling occurs because on a stationary or slow-moving platform, the 32 lasers strike identical positions on every rotation, yielding no increase in sampling density over time.
Second, inefficient field of view utilization results from distributing returns across 360 degrees, such that only a fraction falls within the forward-facing camera view.
These limitations motivated selection of an alternative \ac{LiDAR} technology optimized for forward-facing perception with temporal aggregation.

The Livox Horizon employs a non-repetitive rosette scan pattern that progressively covers its field of view over time rather than repeatedly sampling identical locations.
The sensor features an 81.7° × 25.1° (horizontal × vertical) field of view, substantially wider in azimuth than the 65-degree cameras.
Three Livox units deployed together achieve combined coverage of approximately 165° × 25.1°, providing complete horizontal overlap with the camera array and covering approximately 77\% vertically \cite{thompson2023}.
Table 3.2 presents the Livox Horizon specifications.

\begin{table}[h]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:livox_horizon_specs}
\end{table}

The 905 nm near-infrared wavelength experiences strong absorption by water, resulting in minimal returns from water surfaces.
This characteristic benefits maritime object detection by reducing clutter from waves that would otherwise trigger false positives in clustering algorithms.

The fundamental distinction between the Livox Horizon and traditional spinning \ac{LiDAR} lies in the scan pattern.
A mechanically spinning sensor with N lasers produces N discrete horizontal rings that repeat identically each rotation.
For vessels moving at typical speeds (2-5 m/s), platform displacement between rotations remains small relative to object size, resulting in near-perfect overlap of consecutive scans.
The Livox operates differently, employing a two-dimensional scanning mechanism that traces a non-repetitive rosette pattern across the field of view.
Two orthogonal mirrors operating at slightly different frequencies cause the laser beam to trace a complex Lissajous-like path that progressively fills the field of view without repetition \cite{thompson2023}.

Scan pattern coverage accumulates over time, with longer integration periods yielding denser spatial sampling.
At the standard 100 Hz output rate, each UDP message contains approximately 10 milliseconds of returns.
Over a one-second aggregation period, the rosette pattern provides substantially higher spatial coverage than a spinning sensor's fixed ring geometry.

The non-repetitive forward-scanning nature of the Livox units means that point cloud density is not uniform across the field of view.
The 81.7-degree horizontal field of view allows for overlap between the three units, achieving more uniform density across the 165-degree field of view matching the 4K FLIR camera coverage.

Figure \ref{fig:livox_scan_pattern} illustrates the non-repetitive rosette scan pattern and resulting point cloud density distribution.
This density is critical for the grid-based clustering employed for \ac{LiDAR} object detection in Chapter 5.

Comparison of point cloud density within the camera field of view reveals the Livox advantage.
A Velodyne HDL-32E in dual-return mode produces approximately 1.4 million points per second distributed across the full 360-degree plane.
The camera field of view encompasses approximately 165 degrees, yielding an effective point rate in the region of interest of:

$$\text{Effective HDL-32E rate} = 1.4 \times 10^6 \times \frac{165°}{360°} \approx 641,000 \text{ pts/sec}$$

Three Livox Horizon units in dual-return mode together produce:

$$\text{Combined Livox rate} = 3 \times 480,000 = 1.44 \times 10^6 \text{ pts/sec}$$

This represents a 2.25× increase in point returns within the camera view, excluding additional benefits from superior vertical sampling achieved through the non-repetitive pattern compared to fixed 32-ring geometry \cite{thompson2023}.

The non-repetitive scan pattern demonstrates particular advantage when aggregating multiple scans over time, accumulating points over an integration window to enhance spatial sampling.
On a moving platform, motion compensation during the accumulation period becomes necessary.
The \ac{LiDAR} aggregation approach, detailed in Chapter 5, employs the \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} to track platform pose over time.
Each \ac{LiDAR} point is transformed from sensor coordinates to a world reference frame using the platform pose at that point's timestamp.
All accumulated points are then transformed from world coordinates to the target camera image frame, enabling overlay of a dense point cloud on the image.
A four-second integration period was selected based on empirical evaluation of the tradeoff between point cloud density and motion blur.
Each camera image sampled at 1 Hz receives all \ac{LiDAR} points from the preceding four seconds, transformed to the image capture time.
This approach provides the spatial resolution necessary for reliable detection while maintaining sufficient motion compensation accuracy for typical vessel speeds.

The Livox Horizon sensors communicate via UDP over Ethernet, transmitting point cloud data as binary messages at 100 Hz.
Livox provides an open-source \ac{ROS} SDK that manages network communication, message parsing, and point cloud publication to \ac{ROS} topics.
Integration of the Livox SDK into the Minion software required minimal effort, primarily involving network configuration and modification of \ac{ROS} launch files.
The SDK operates on the Atlas PC, receiving UDP messages from all three \ac{LiDAR} units simultaneously over the local network described in Section 3.1.2.3.

Accurate fusion of data from multiple \ac{LiDAR} units requires precise knowledge of sensor geometric relationships.
The Livox Horizon units feature onboard storage for extrinsic calibration parameters, enabling each sensor to transform its measurements to a common reference frame before transmission.
The \ac{LiDAR}-to-\ac{LiDAR} extrinsic calibration presented in Section 3.2.1.3 determines the six-degree-of-freedom transformation (translation and rotation) relating each sensor's local coordinates to the designated primary sensor.
These parameters are written to non-volatile memory on each Livox unit, configuring automatic application of the transformation such that all point clouds emerge in the center \ac{LiDAR}'s reference frame \cite{thompson2023}.
This onboard configuration simplifies downstream processing by eliminating the need for software-based registration of the three point clouds.
The unified cloud is subsequently related to camera coordinates through camera-to-\ac{LiDAR} extrinsic calibration described in Section 3.2.1.2.

Temporal alignment of \ac{LiDAR} with camera images and \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} pose requires all \ac{LiDAR} points to possess timestamps referenced to a common global time base.
The Livox Horizon supports IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol, providing sub-microsecond clock synchronization with a PTP master on the network.
In this configuration, the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier in the camera box functions as the PTP master, synchronizing the three \ac{LiDAR} units.
The Jetson itself synchronizes to \ac{GPS} time via the Network Time Protocol hierarchy detailed in Section 3.2.2.1.
This cascaded synchronization ensures \ac{LiDAR} timestamps share the same \ac{GPS}-disciplined time reference as camera frames, enabling frame-accurate alignment for fusion.
PTP synchronization status is verified using the Livox Viewer software, which displays sync state and time source for each sensor.
Proper PTP lock is confirmed prior to data collection, ensuring timestamp accuracy.

An advantageous characteristic of the 905 nm wavelength is its strong absorption by water.
This results in minimal \ac{LiDAR} returns from water surfaces, contrasting with vision sensors that clearly image water texture and waves.
Absence of water returns reduces point cloud clutter and simplifies object detection by eliminating the need to filter ground plane points for the water surface.
Point cloud visualizations overlaid on camera images demonstrate this characteristic: dense \ac{LiDAR} coverage appears on vessels, buoys, and other solid objects, while water surfaces produce few or no returns.
For grid-based clustering, this characteristic prevents false positives from wave crests or foam patterns.

The Livox Horizon configuration provides several capabilities essential for comparing object detection performance.
The system achieves 2.25× more points within the camera view compared to omnidirectional spinning sensors, while the non-repetitive scan pattern enhances sampling density through temporal aggregation.
Per-point timestamps and \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} integration enable accurate aggregation during motion, while PTP synchronization provides sub-microsecond timing accuracy relative to cameras and \ac{GPS}.
Factory-configured multi-sensor calibration unifies point clouds from three sensors before transmission, and the 905 nm wavelength reduces maritime clutter by rejecting water returns.
Combined with the software integration and synchronization infrastructure described in Section 3.2, this configuration enables rigorous \ac{LiDAR} detection evaluation and comparison with vision-based approaches in Chapters 5 and 6.

            \subsubsection{Pinpoint GPS/INS}

The Minion platform features a single Pinpoint \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} with differential corrections.
The system performs two critical functions in the perception architecture: providing precise global time for sensor synchronization, and tracking vessel position and orientation for motion correction of \ac{LiDAR} data.
The \ac{GPS} receiver functions as the master clock for the entire synchronization hierarchy described in Section 3.2.2.1, while the integrated \ac{IMU} enables high-rate pose updates between \ac{GPS} fixes.

Global Navigation Satellite System signals inherently carry highly accurate timing information, as satellite positioning operates through precise measurement of signal delay from multiple satellites with synchronized atomic clocks.
The Pinpoint receiver extracts this timing information and distributes it over the vessel's network using Network Time Protocol.
The \ac{GPS} unit was assigned a static IP address of 201.7.90.30 on the Minion network and configured to broadcast \ac{GPS}-disciplined time via Network Time Protocol.
The Atlas PC main computer synchronizes its clock to this \ac{GPS} source with typical accuracy in the tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, limited primarily by network latency rather than \ac{GPS} accuracy.

This \ac{GPS} time reference propagates through the synchronization hierarchy to every computing resource on the platform.
Atlas functions as a Network Time Protocol server for the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier camera computer, which subsequently operates as a Precision Time Protocol master for the Livox Horizon \ac{LiDAR} sensors.
This cascaded approach ensures timestamps from all sensors—cameras, \ac{LiDAR}, and \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS}—share a common time reference traceable to \ac{GPS} time.

Beyond timekeeping, the \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} system continuously tracks platform position and orientation, which is required for \ac{LiDAR} temporal aggregation.
As described in Section 3.1.1.3, accumulating \ac{LiDAR} points over several seconds necessitates compensation for vessel motion during that period.
The Pinpoint system fuses \ac{GPS} position measurements with \ac{IMU} acceleration and rotation data through an Extended Kalman Filter to produce pose estimates at rates substantially higher than \ac{GPS} alone could provide.
\ac{GPS} fixes arrive at 1-10 Hz depending on satellite visibility, while the \ac{IMU} operates at hundreds of hertz.
The fusion algorithm propagates pose estimates forward using \ac{IMU} integration between \ac{GPS} updates, subsequently correcting accumulated drift when new \ac{GPS} measurements arrive.

The resulting pose solution provides six-degree-of-freedom state estimates—three-dimensional position and three-dimensional orientation—at sufficient temporal resolution to interpolate platform pose to the exact timestamp of each \ac{LiDAR} point.
This capability supports the transformation methodology presented in Chapter 5, where \ac{LiDAR} points acquired at different times during motion are transformed to a common reference frame before projection onto camera images.

The Pinpoint \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} connects to the Minion computing infrastructure via Ethernet, utilizing both Network Time Protocol for time distribution and User Datagram Protocol for pose data transmission.
\ac{ROS} driver nodes on the Atlas PC receive and parse the binary \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} messages, publishing pose estimates as standard \ac{ROS} geometry messages.
These messages incorporate position (latitude, longitude, altitude), orientation (roll, pitch, yaw), uncertainty estimates, and \ac{GPS} fix quality flags.
The \ac{ROS} tf2 library consumes these pose estimates to maintain the time-varying transformation tree relating sensor frames to platform and world frames, enabling automated coordinate transformation for sensor fusion.

The \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} defines the inertial reference frame for the platform, with position expressed in geographic coordinates (WGS84 datum) and orientation relative to true north and local gravity.
This world-referenced system serves as the common reference for transforming observations from multiple sensors acquired at different times during motion.
Transformation from sensor-local frames to the \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} world frame requires knowledge of sensor-to-platform extrinsic calibration parameters.
These parameters are determined through calibration procedures described in Section 3.2.1.2 for cameras and Section 3.2.1.3 for \ac{LiDAR} sensors.
With extrinsic parameters established, the \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} pose solution enables transformation of any sensor observation to world coordinates or to any other sensor's reference frame.

Maritime environments present challenges for \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} systems that differ from land vehicle applications.
Water surface reflections induce multipath interference in \ac{GPS} signals, while vessel pitch and roll motion exercises the full range of the \ac{IMU}.
The Pinpoint system was designed for marine applications and incorporates algorithms to address these factors while maintaining accuracy during vessel maneuvering.
\ac{GPS} accuracy degrades in areas with limited satellite visibility, such as proximity to tall structures, bridges, or fjord-like coastal terrain.
The \ac{IMU} provides short-term pose continuity during \ac{GPS} outages, though accumulated drift limits the duration for which pure inertial navigation remains accurate.
Data collection operations were conducted in open water with favorable satellite visibility, ensuring consistent \ac{GPS} fix quality throughout recording sessions.

The \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} system enables two functions essential for multi-modal sensor fusion research.
First, \ac{GPS}-disciplined time distributed to all sensors ensures timestamps from cameras, \ac{LiDAR}, and \ac{GPS} itself reference the same time base, providing frame-accurate temporal association across modalities.
Second, continuous pose estimates enable transformation of temporally distributed observations to common reference frames, supporting \ac{LiDAR} aggregation during motion and registration of sensor fields of view for fusion operations.
Combined with the synchronization verification and drift correction procedures described in Section 3.2.2, these capabilities establish the temporal and spatial foundation for rigorous object detection performance evaluation across sensing modalities.
The \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} thus functions not merely as a navigation sensor but as critical infrastructure enabling the multi-modal perception analysis central to this research.
