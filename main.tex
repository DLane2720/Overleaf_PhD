\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Significance of Study}

The development of \acp{ASV} represents a significant technological advancement requiring sophisticated perception systems capable of detecting and classifying maritime objects with high accuracy and reliability in real-time operational environments. As \ac{ASV} technology advances toward practical deployment in commercial and research applications, understanding the comparative performance characteristics of different sensing modalities and their integration through sensor fusion methodologies becomes critical for effective system design and operational safety assurance.

The advancement of autonomous surface vessel technology has gained significant momentum through comprehensive research programs and competitive evaluation platforms such as the Maritime RobotX Challenge, where multidisciplinary teams develop and test \ac{ASV} platforms under realistic maritime operational conditions. These research platforms serve as essential testbeds for evaluating perception technologies under actual environmental constraints, providing valuable empirical insights into sensor performance characteristics, real-time processing capabilities, and complex system integration challenges that cannot be adequately assessed through simulation alone.

Research platforms provide critical opportunities for real-world validation of perception algorithms under actual maritime conditions with operational time constraints. These platforms enable comprehensive comparative analysis opportunities for evaluating different sensor modalities and advanced sensor fusion approaches under controlled yet realistic testing scenarios. Furthermore, research platforms facilitate essential technology transfer pathways from experimental research systems to operational \ac{ASV} deployments requiring robust real-time performance guarantees. Finally, these platforms enable systematic performance benchmarking that supports rigorous evaluation of detection accuracy, classification reliability, and sensor fusion effectiveness across diverse maritime operational scenarios.

Current \ac{ASV} development faces a significant knowledge gap regarding the quantitative performance characteristics of different sensing modalities and their integration methodologies in complex maritime environments. While individual sensor technologies, particularly \ac{LiDAR} systems and vision-based cameras, have been extensively studied and validated in terrestrial applications, their comparative performance characteristics and sensor fusion integration capabilities in maritime contexts lack systematic quantitative analysis with emphasis on real-time processing constraints and computational efficiency requirements.

Comprehensive performance analysis requires systematic detection accuracy comparison between \ac{LiDAR}-based systems utilizing \ac{GB-CACHE} processing and vision-based systems implementing \ac{YOLO} object detection algorithms. Additionally, rigorous classification performance evaluation across diverse maritime object types using advanced machine learning algorithms must be conducted to establish performance baselines. Assessment of training requirements for machine learning-based classification systems, particularly focusing on data efficiency and convergence characteristics, represents another critical analytical requirement. Real-time processing capabilities and computational efficiency evaluation under operational constraints must be systematically analyzed to ensure practical deployment feasibility. Moreover, sensor fusion effectiveness evaluation, specifically examining bounding box confidence integration methodologies, requires comprehensive analysis to determine optimal multi-modal processing approaches. Finally, environmental robustness evaluation across varying maritime conditions, including different weather states, lighting conditions, and sea states, must be conducted to ensure reliable operational performance.

\ac{ASV} perception systems must reliably detect and classify a diverse range of maritime objects that are critical for safe autonomous navigation, requiring robust algorithms capable of real-time processing under challenging environmental conditions. The maritime environment presents unique detection challenges due to varying lighting conditions, wave-induced platform motion, and the diverse physical characteristics of navigation-critical objects that must be accurately identified and classified. Navigation buoys, including Polyform A-2 and A-3 buoys available in various colors for channel marking and navigation guidance, represent primary detection targets requiring high accuracy classification. Regulatory markers, specifically Sur-Mark tall buoys designed for navigation reference and hazard identification, present distinct detection challenges due to their geometric characteristics and operational deployment contexts. Light towers serving as active navigation aids provide both visual and electronic guidance signals, requiring detection algorithms capable of handling variable illumination and signaling states. Various vessels, including recreational boats and commercial watercraft, represent dynamic detection targets with diverse size, shape, and motion characteristics that complicate reliable classification. Maritime infrastructure elements, including docks, piers, and other fixed navigational hazards, require robust detection capabilities to ensure safe autonomous navigation in complex harbor and coastal environments.

% \subsection{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Problem Statement: Performance Comparison Gap}

Despite the growing operational importance of autonomous surface vessels and the significant maturation of individual sensor technologies over the past decade, there exists a critical and well-documented gap in quantitative performance comparison between different sensing modalities specifically applied to maritime object detection and classification tasks. Current \ac{ASV} development efforts lack systematic analytical frameworks for evaluating how \ac{LiDAR}-based systems utilizing advanced point cloud processing algorithms perform relative to vision-based systems implementing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches when deployed in realistic maritime operational environments.

Existing research efforts in maritime object detection and classification have primarily focused on individual sensor implementations and algorithm development without conducting comprehensive comparative analysis that would inform optimal sensor selection and integration strategies for operational \ac{ASV} systems. Contemporary research demonstrates a predominant focus on \ac{LiDAR}-only implementations that emphasize point cloud processing methodologies and clustering algorithms specifically adapted for maritime environments, yet these studies typically lack comparative evaluation against alternative sensing modalities. Similarly, vision-only system research emphasizes deep learning approaches for maritime object recognition, particularly convolutional neural network architectures, but generally operates in isolation without systematic comparison to \ac{LiDAR}-based approaches. The limited cross-modal comparison studies that do exist provide insufficient quantitative performance metrics and lack standardized evaluation frameworks necessary for meaningful comparative analysis. Furthermore, there exists a notable absence of standardized evaluation frameworks specifically designed for maritime perception systems, hindering systematic comparison and technology advancement across research groups and commercial developers.

The absence of comprehensive quantitative performance analysis leaves fundamental technical and operational questions unanswered for \ac{ASV} system designers and engineers responsible for developing reliable autonomous navigation systems. Critical questions regarding detection and classification performance remain inadequately addressed in current research literature. Specifically, the comparative detection accuracy performance of \ac{LiDAR}-based systems utilizing \ac{GB-CACHE} processing versus vision-based systems implementing \ac{YOLO} algorithms for specific maritime object types requires systematic investigation. The precision and recall characteristics of each sensing modality across different object classes under varying environmental conditions need quantitative evaluation to inform sensor selection decisions. Training requirements, including data volume, computational resources, and convergence time, differ significantly between \ac{LiDAR} feature-based approaches and vision-based deep learning methodologies, yet these differences lack systematic quantification. Computational overhead associated with each sensing modality for real-time operation, including processing latency and resource utilization, requires comprehensive analysis to ensure practical deployment feasibility. Additionally, the effectiveness of sensor fusion methodologies, particularly bounding box confidence integration approaches, needs rigorous evaluation to determine optimal multi-modal processing strategies for enhanced detection performance.

% \subsection{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Problem Statement: Sensor Fusion Challenges}

Autonomous surface vessels require precise integration of multiple sensing modalities to achieve reliable object detection and classification performance that meets operational safety standards for autonomous navigation. A fundamental and persistent challenge in \ac{ASV} perception system development lies in establishing and maintaining accurate spatial and temporal calibration between \ac{LiDAR} and camera systems under dynamic maritime operational conditions that present unique environmental challenges not encountered in terrestrial applications.

Multi-sensor \ac{ASV} platforms face unique spatial calibration requirements that differ significantly from terrestrial applications due to the dynamic nature of maritime environments and the continuous mechanical stresses imposed by marine operational conditions. Environmental factors affecting calibration present ongoing challenges for maintaining sensor alignment accuracy. Platform motion induced by wave action creates continuous roll, pitch, and yaw movements that affect sensor alignment and require robust calibration maintenance strategies. Vibration and mechanical stress inherent in marine environments cause gradual calibration drift that can degrade sensor fusion performance over extended operational periods. Temperature variations in maritime environments affect sensor mounting structures and optical characteristics, potentially introducing systematic calibration errors that must be compensated through adaptive calibration procedures. Saltwater corrosion presents long-term challenges by potentially altering sensor mounting hardware characteristics over extended deployment periods, requiring regular calibration validation and maintenance protocols.

Precision requirements for effective sensor fusion establish demanding performance specifications for calibration maintenance systems that must operate reliably under dynamic maritime conditions. Sub-pixel accuracy calibration is essential for accurate \ac{LiDAR} point cloud projection onto camera images, enabling effective correlation between sensor modalities for object detection applications and ensuring that spatial relationships between sensors remain consistent across operational scenarios. Millimeter-level precision in spatial calibration is required for effective object detection correlation between \ac{LiDAR} and vision systems, particularly for small maritime objects such as navigation buoys where detection accuracy directly impacts navigation safety. Consistent calibration maintenance across varying operational conditions, including different sea states and weather conditions, requires robust calibration validation procedures that can adapt to changing environmental parameters. Real-time calibration validation capabilities are necessary for detecting calibration degradation during operation and implementing corrective measures to maintain sensor fusion performance without interrupting autonomous navigation operations.

\subsection{Limitations and Assumptions}

This research investigation is conducted using \ac{ERAU}'s Minion \ac{ASV} research platform and utilizes sensor data collected during the 2024 Maritime RobotX Challenge competition, which establishes specific operational and methodological constraints that define the scope and applicability of research findings.

Platform-specific limitations inherent in this research approach must be acknowledged and considered when interpreting results and their broader applicability. Research findings are specifically applicable to \ac{ERAU}'s Minion research platform design, including its particular sensor mounting configuration, platform dynamics characteristics, and operational capabilities, which may not directly translate to other \ac{ASV} platform designs. The competition environment context, where primary data collection occurred during RobotX challenge events, may not represent the full spectrum of maritime operational conditions encountered in commercial or military \ac{ASV} deployments. Geographic constraints imposed by conducting testing in competition and training areas introduce environmental characteristics that may not be representative of other maritime operational regions. Operational scenarios focused on RobotX challenge tasks may not encompass the complete range of potential \ac{ASV} mission requirements and environmental conditions encountered in practical autonomous vessel operations.

This research focuses on specific maritime object categories that are relevant to RobotX competition scenarios and representative of typical \ac{ASV} navigation challenges, while acknowledging that maritime environments contain additional object types not addressed in this investigation. The research addresses six primary object classes that represent critical navigation elements in maritime environments. Tall buoys, specifically Sur-Mark regulatory buoys with standardized dimensions of 39-inch height, 10-inch column diameter, and 18-inch ring diameter, represent regulatory navigation markers requiring reliable detection and classification. Polyform A-2 buoys, measuring 14.5 inches by 19.5 inches and available in red, green, blue, and black color variants, serve as channel markers and navigation references requiring color-specific classification capabilities. Polyform A-3 buoys, with dimensions of 17 inches by 23 inches and identical color availability, represent larger navigation buoys requiring robust detection across varying distances and environmental conditions. Light towers function as active navigation aids incorporating electronic and visual signaling capabilities, presenting detection challenges due to variable illumination states and complex geometric structures. Jon boats, characterized as flat-bottom chase boats utilized in competition and training scenarios, represent small vessel detection targets with distinct geometric and motion characteristics. Sailboats, including recreational sailing vessels commonly encountered in competition environments, represent larger vessel detection targets with variable configuration due to sail and rigging arrangements.

\chapter{Review of the Relevant Literature}

% Note: All in-text citations should appear as \cite{einstein}

\acp{USV} have emerged as essential platforms capable of performing dangerous, dirty, and cumbersome tasks that exceed human capability. These vessels are pivotal in various maritime operations, including environmental monitoring, search and rescue missions, and resource exploration \cite{liebergall, eckstein2024}.% [1], [2]. 
Their ability to operate independently with minimal human intervention has significantly enhanced operational efficiency and safety at sea \cite{bai2022}.%[3].

Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings but primarily rely on some combination of visual information through a camera and spatial data provided by \ac{LiDAR} \cite{yeong2021}.%[4].
Each sensing modality offers distinct advantages: visual data provides rich color and texture information, while \ac{LiDAR} delivers precise spatial measurements of the surrounding environment.
Real-time object detection methods have been developed for both sensing modalities, leveraging deep learning architectures.
Object detection with visual data often employs transfer learning on pre-trained convolutional neural networks such as ResNet \cite{he2016} and \ac{YOLO} \cite{ultralytics}.%[6].
Similarly, \ac{LiDAR}-based object detection can be performed using point-based algorithms like PointNet \cite{garcia-garcia2016}, voxel-based methods such as VoxelNet \cite{zhou2018a}, or hybrid approaches like PV-RCNN \cite{shi2021}.%[9].
Despite these advancements, each modality has inherent limitations—vision-based systems struggle with poor lighting conditions and occlusions, while \ac{LiDAR} data can be sparse and affected by water reflections.

To address these limitations, sensor fusion techniques have been explored as a means of combining the strengths of both modalities. 
Research into sensor fusion methods dates back to military applications in the 1980s and has gained significant traction in the last 15 years, particularly due to interest from the automotive industry in autonomous driving technologies. However, no unified approach has been established for optimal sensor fusion, with ongoing debates regarding the best fusion strategies (e.g., early, mid, or late fusion) and their trade-offs concerning computational efficiency and accuracy.

While research in the automotive sector has contributed significantly to sensor fusion methodologies \cite{yeong2021,clunie2021,roriz2022,cui2022,das2022,liu2023a}, direct application to maritime environments remains challenging due to fundamental environmental differences. 
Automotive environments are highly structured, with well-defined lanes, uniform object classes, and relatively predictable lighting conditions. 
In contrast, the maritime environment introduces additional complexities, including dynamic vehicle motion induced by wind and waves, variable scene density (ranging from sparse open waters to congested littoral zones), and specular reflections on the water surface that can interfere with both vision-based \cite{liu2023a} and \ac{LiDAR}-based object detection \cite{ahmed2024}.%[15]. 
These factors necessitate domain-specific adaptations of sensor fusion architectures to ensure robust real-time object detection for \acp{USV}. 
However, the lack of available maritime-specific datasets \cite{jun-hwa2022,su2023,thompson2023} creates an additional challenge.

Given these challenges, further research is needed to enhance sensor fusion methodologies for maritime applications. 
Key areas of investigation include efficient feature selection tailored to maritime object classes, the development of lightweight fusion architectures suited for real-time processing, and an evaluation of computational requirements for deployment on \ac{USV} hardware. 
Addressing these research gaps will contribute to the advancement of autonomous maritime perception, enhancing the operational capabilities of \acp{USV} in complex and dynamic environments.

    \section{USV Platform}

        \subsection{Sensors}
        
            \subsubsection{Perception Geometry}

The Minion's sensor layout maximizes overlap between vision and \ac{LiDAR} in both spatial and temporal domains, providing the necessary foundation for reliable multi-modal object detection and sensor fusion.
The geometry emphasizes forward-facing coverage, aligning with maritime navigation requirements where objects of interest predominantly appear ahead of the vessel during transit.

This configuration combines sensors with complementary strengths while compensating for individual limitations.
The \ac{HDR} cameras provide dense pixel-level information with rich texture and color, while \ac{LiDAR} offers precise 3D spatial measurements independent of lighting conditions.
Arranging the sensors to observe the same spatial volume satisfies the fundamental requirement for effective late fusion.

Three Leopard Imaging IMX490 \ac{HDR} cameras are arranged with overlapping horizontal coverage.
Each camera possesses a 65-degree horizontal field of view, positioned with strategic overlap to create a composite forward-facing envelope.
This configuration provides comprehensive visual coverage of the navigation corridor while maintaining sufficient overlap for potential stereoscopic depth estimation.
Three Livox Horizon \ac{LiDAR} units complement the cameras, providing spatial coverage designed to overlap with the camera field of view.
Each Livox unit features an 81.7° × 25.1° (horizontal × vertical) field of view, substantially wider than the cameras in azimuth.
The three units positioned together deliver approximately 165° × 25.1° of combined coverage, achieving complete horizontal overlap with the camera system and covering approximately 77\% vertically \cite{thompson2023}.

Forward-facing \ac{LiDAR} sensors were selected over traditional 360-degree rotating units due to their superior performance for sensor fusion applications.
While mechanically rotating systems like the Velodyne HDL-32E distribute returns across the full horizontal plane, the Livox units concentrate sampling density within the forward camera field of view.
This concentration provides enhanced point cloud density in the region of interest, improving spatial resolution for object detection.
The Livox scan pattern differs fundamentally from traditional spinning \ac{LiDAR}.
Rather than sampling fixed vertical rings that repeat with each rotation, the Livox units trace a rosette pattern that progressively covers the entire field of view over a one-second period \cite{thompson2023}.
This non-repetitive pattern yields substantially higher spatial sampling when aggregating multiple scans over time, as detailed in Section 3.1.1.3.

All sensor measurements are registered to a common spatial reference frame centered on the vessel.
Extrinsic calibration procedures, detailed in Section 3.2.1, establish precise geometric relationships between individual sensors.
The \ac{LiDAR} units incorporate factory-configured inter-sensor calibration, enabling all three Livox devices to report points from a unified origin at the center sensor position.
A Pinpoint \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} system tracks the platform's position and orientation, facilitating transformation of sensor observations between the vessel frame and world coordinates.
This capability is essential for temporal aggregation of \ac{LiDAR} observations during vessel motion, as described in Section 3.2.2.

The perception geometry reflects several priorities specific to the maritime research objectives.
Maximum spatial overlap between vision and \ac{LiDAR} enables direct comparison of detection performance and validation of late fusion approaches.
The forward-facing emphasis acknowledges that maritime collision avoidance and navigation planning require detailed perception of the forward hemisphere, rendering 360-degree coverage unnecessary for this application.
Concentrating \ac{LiDAR} sampling within the camera field of view achieves higher point cloud density than omnidirectional sensors with comparable point budgets.
The Livox scan pattern combined with \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} integration enables accumulation of observations during motion, further enhancing effective spatial resolution.
This sensor configuration provides the geometric foundation for the comparative object detection analysis.
The following subsections detail individual sensor specifications.

            \subsubsection{HDR Camera}

Three Leopard Imaging LI-USB30-IMX490-GW5400-GMSL2-065H \ac{HDR} cameras serve as the vision component of Minion's perception system.
These cameras were selected specifically to address the challenging lighting conditions characteristic of maritime environments, including bright sky, reflective water surfaces, and shadowed objects appearing simultaneously within the same scene.
Extended dynamic range is essential to preserve visual detail across this broad luminance spectrum \cite{thompson2023}.

The Leopard Imaging IMX490 incorporates Sony's automotive-grade image sensor, originally designed for advanced driver assistance systems facing similar environmental challenges.
Table 3.1 presents the camera's key specifications.

\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:hdr_camera_specs}
\end{table}

The 2880×1860 resolution provides sufficient spatial detail for detecting objects at relevant ranges in autonomous vessel navigation, while the 25 fps frame rate adequately supports typical vessel speeds and maneuvering.
Deploying the three cameras with overlapping 65-degree fields of view achieves the wide forward-facing coverage described in Section 3.1.1.1.

The IMX490 employs a two-stage interface design that separates the camera head from image processing.
The sensor communicates via Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link 2 to a secondary box containing dedicated image processing hardware.
This Leopard Imaging image processor performs debayering, white balance, gamma correction, and \ac{HDR} tone mapping in a fixed pipeline with no user-configurable parameters \cite{thompson2023}.
The processor box outputs USB 3.0 configured as a Universal Video Class device, enabling compatibility with standard operating system video interfaces without proprietary drivers.
Under Ubuntu Linux, the cameras are accessed through Video for Linux version 2, the standard kernel interface for video capture.

Video capture from the \ac{HDR} cameras utilizes GStreamer, an industry-standard pipeline-based framework for media processing.
GStreamer's modular design enables construction of complex video pipelines from individual functional blocks connected in directed graphs.
The \texttt{v4l2src} element interfaces with the Video for Linux kernel to acquire raw frames, which subsequently flow through a pipeline incorporating format conversion, encoding, and streaming.
However, standard GStreamer pipelines employ timestamps relative to stream start, which proves inadequate for multi-sensor fusion requiring absolute time references for temporal alignment.
This limitation was addressed through development of a custom GStreamer plugin that injects absolute system timestamps into the video stream.
Section 3.2.2.2 describes the timestamp plugin implementation and the Supplemental Enhancement Information embedding method employed.

The custom plugin operates as a GStreamer pad probe attached to the \texttt{v4l2src} output \cite{thompson2023}.
Upon receipt of each new image buffer from the camera, the plugin samples system time using the POSIX \texttt{gettimeofday()} function, acquiring the Unix epoch timestamp in milliseconds.
This timestamp is associated with the video frame through one of two methods: external CSV logging, which writes frame number and timestamp to a file for subsequent lookup, or in-band embedding, which places the timestamp directly in the video bitstream as metadata.
The in-band approach, detailed in Section 3.2.2.2, proves superior because timing information remains bound to the image data through recording, playback, and network transmission, preventing inadvertent separation.
This persistence is essential for the temporal drift analysis and correction described in Section 3.2.2.3.

Accurate timestamps require the system clock to maintain synchronization with the global time reference shared by all sensors.
The \ac{HDR} cameras operate on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier embedded computer, which synchronizes its clock via Network Time Protocol to the Atlas PC.
Atlas derives its time from the Pinpoint \ac{GPS} receiver, establishing the hierarchical time distribution detailed in Section 3.2.2.1.
Prior to initiating the video pipeline, the camera software verifies that Network Time Protocol synchronization is established and the clock corresponds to \ac{GPS} time.
Streaming commences only after this verification, ensuring all timestamps reflect \ac{GPS}-disciplined time from the first frame onward.
This verification prevents recording data with erroneous timestamps that would compromise temporal alignment in subsequent processing.

The maritime environment influenced both camera selection and deployment approach.
The \ac{HDR} capability addresses extreme brightness differences between sky, water, and shadowed structures, while the automotive-grade sensor provides environmental sealing and a temperature range suitable for outdoor operation.
The USB 3.0 interface enables placement of the camera in weatherproof housing separate from the computing hardware, with the specification supporting cable runs up to 5 meters.
The three cameras are mounted in individual weatherproof boxes integrated into the camera enclosure assembly described in Section 3.1.2.2, which manages power distribution, environmental protection, and network connectivity while preserving the required geometric relationships.

The IMX490's native \ac{HDR} combines multiple exposures in a single frame period, achieving 120 dB dynamic range without sequential multi-exposure capture.
This simultaneous approach eliminates motion artifacts associated with temporal bracketing, which is critical when both the platform and targets are in motion.
Image quality validation and intrinsic calibration are addressed in Section 3.2.1.1, including lens distortion characterization and camera matrix estimation.
The combination of wide dynamic range, moderate resolution, and calibrated geometry provides the image quality necessary for training and evaluating vision-based detection models in Chapter 5.

Thompson et al. \cite{thompson2023} originally developed this camera hardware and integration approach, establishing a foundation for maritime perception research.
The primary enhancement introduced in this work comprises in-band timestamp embedding and temporal drift correction detailed in Section 3.2.2, which are essential for rigorous multi-modal sensor fusion analysis.

            \subsubsection{Livox Horizon}

Three Livox Horizon solid-state \ac{LiDAR} units provide spatial sensing capability.
These sensors were selected to replace the existing Velodyne mechanical spinning sensors based on their superior point cloud density within the camera field of view and non-repetitive scan pattern that enhances coverage through temporal aggregation \cite{thompson2023}.

Initial planning considered utilizing the Velodyne HDL-32E and VLP-16 sensors already installed on the Minion platform.
However, analysis of point cloud density within the camera field of view revealed fundamental limitations of mechanically rotating \ac{LiDAR} for sensor fusion applications.
Traditional spinning sensors like the Velodyne HDL-32E employ a fixed vertical array of laser emitters that rotates horizontally at constant speed.
The HDL-32E incorporates 32 laser channels arranged vertically across approximately 40 degrees of elevation.
This array rotates at 10 Hz, producing 32 discrete horizontal rings of returns distributed across the full 360-degree plane \cite{thompson2023}.

While 360-degree coverage provides comprehensive spatial awareness, it presents challenges for camera-\ac{LiDAR} fusion.
First, sparse azimuthal sampling occurs because on a stationary or slow-moving platform, the 32 lasers strike identical positions on every rotation, yielding no increase in sampling density over time.
Second, inefficient field of view utilization results from distributing returns across 360 degrees, such that only a fraction falls within the forward-facing camera view.
These limitations motivated selection of an alternative \ac{LiDAR} technology optimized for forward-facing perception with temporal aggregation.

The Livox Horizon employs a non-repetitive rosette scan pattern that progressively covers its field of view over time rather than repeatedly sampling identical locations.
The sensor features an 81.7° × 25.1° (horizontal × vertical) field of view, substantially wider in azimuth than the 65-degree cameras.
Three Livox units deployed together achieve combined coverage of approximately 165° × 25.1°, providing complete horizontal overlap with the camera array and covering approximately 77\% vertically \cite{thompson2023}.
Table 3.2 presents the Livox Horizon specifications.

The 905 nm near-infrared wavelength experiences strong absorption by water, resulting in minimal returns from water surfaces.
This characteristic benefits maritime object detection by reducing clutter from waves that would otherwise trigger false positives in clustering algorithms.

The fundamental distinction between the Livox Horizon and traditional spinning \ac{LiDAR} lies in the scan pattern.
A mechanically spinning sensor with N lasers produces N discrete horizontal rings that repeat identically each rotation.
For vessels moving at typical speeds (2-5 m/s), platform displacement between rotations remains small relative to object size, resulting in near-perfect overlap of consecutive scans.
The Livox operates differently, employing a two-dimensional scanning mechanism that traces a non-repetitive rosette pattern across the field of view.
Two orthogonal mirrors operating at slightly different frequencies cause the laser beam to trace a complex Lissajous-like path that progressively fills the field of view without repetition \cite{thompson2023}.

Scan pattern coverage accumulates over time, with longer integration periods yielding denser spatial sampling.
At the standard 100 Hz output rate, each UDP message contains approximately 10 milliseconds of returns.
Over a one-second aggregation period, the rosette pattern provides substantially higher spatial coverage than a spinning sensor's fixed ring geometry.
Figure 3.7 in \cite{thompson2023} demonstrates this advantage by projecting one second of Livox data onto an \ac{HDR} camera image, revealing dense coverage across the image with minimal gaps.
This density is critical for the grid-based clustering employed for \ac{LiDAR} object detection in Chapter 5.

Comparison of point cloud density within the camera field of view reveals the Livox advantage.
A Velodyne HDL-32E in dual-return mode produces approximately 1.4 million points per second distributed across the full 360-degree plane.
The camera field of view encompasses approximately 165 degrees, yielding an effective point rate in the region of interest of:

$$\text{Effective HDL-32E rate} = 1.4 \times 10^6 \times \frac{165°}{360°} \approx 641,000 \text{ pts/sec}$$

Three Livox Horizon units in dual-return mode together produce:

$$\text{Combined Livox rate} = 3 \times 480,000 = 1.44 \times 10^6 \text{ pts/sec}$$

This represents a 2.25× increase in point returns within the camera view, excluding additional benefits from superior vertical sampling achieved through the non-repetitive pattern compared to fixed 32-ring geometry \cite{thompson2023}.

The non-repetitive scan pattern demonstrates particular advantage when aggregating multiple scans over time, accumulating points over an integration window to enhance spatial sampling.
On a moving platform, motion compensation during the accumulation period becomes necessary.
The \ac{LiDAR} aggregation approach, detailed in Chapter 5, employs the \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} to track platform pose over time.
Each \ac{LiDAR} point is transformed from sensor coordinates to a world reference frame using the platform pose at that point's timestamp.
All accumulated points are then transformed from world coordinates to the target camera image frame, enabling overlay of a dense point cloud on the image.
A four-second integration period was selected based on empirical evaluation of the tradeoff between point cloud density and motion blur.
Each camera image sampled at 1 Hz receives all \ac{LiDAR} points from the preceding four seconds, transformed to the image capture time.
This approach provides the spatial resolution necessary for reliable detection while maintaining sufficient motion compensation accuracy for typical vessel speeds.

The Livox Horizon sensors communicate via UDP over Ethernet, transmitting point cloud data as binary messages at 100 Hz.
Livox provides an open-source \ac{ROS} SDK that manages network communication, message parsing, and point cloud publication to \ac{ROS} topics.
Integration of the Livox SDK into the Minion software required minimal effort, primarily involving network configuration and modification of \ac{ROS} launch files.
The SDK operates on the Atlas PC, receiving UDP messages from all three \ac{LiDAR} units simultaneously over the local network described in Section 3.1.2.3.

Accurate fusion of data from multiple \ac{LiDAR} units requires precise knowledge of sensor geometric relationships.
The Livox Horizon units feature onboard storage for extrinsic calibration parameters, enabling each sensor to transform its measurements to a common reference frame before transmission.
The \ac{LiDAR}-to-\ac{LiDAR} extrinsic calibration presented in Section 3.2.1.3 determines the six-degree-of-freedom transformation (translation and rotation) relating each sensor's local coordinates to the designated primary sensor.
These parameters are written to non-volatile memory on each Livox unit, configuring automatic application of the transformation such that all point clouds emerge in the center \ac{LiDAR}'s reference frame \cite{thompson2023}.
This onboard configuration simplifies downstream processing by eliminating the need for software-based registration of the three point clouds.
The unified cloud is subsequently related to camera coordinates through camera-to-\ac{LiDAR} extrinsic calibration described in Section 3.2.1.2.

Temporal alignment of \ac{LiDAR} with camera images and \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} pose requires all \ac{LiDAR} points to possess timestamps referenced to a common global time base.
The Livox Horizon supports IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol, providing sub-microsecond clock synchronization with a PTP master on the network.
In this configuration, the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier in the camera box functions as the PTP master, synchronizing the three \ac{LiDAR} units.
The Jetson itself synchronizes to \ac{GPS} time via the Network Time Protocol hierarchy detailed in Section 3.2.2.1.
This cascaded synchronization ensures \ac{LiDAR} timestamps share the same \ac{GPS}-disciplined time reference as camera frames, enabling frame-accurate alignment for fusion.
PTP synchronization status is verified using the Livox Viewer software, which displays sync state and time source for each sensor.
Proper PTP lock is confirmed prior to data collection, ensuring timestamp accuracy.

An advantageous characteristic of the 905 nm wavelength is its strong absorption by water.
This results in minimal \ac{LiDAR} returns from water surfaces, contrasting with vision sensors that clearly image water texture and waves.
Absence of water returns reduces point cloud clutter and simplifies object detection by eliminating the need to filter ground plane points for the water surface.
Point cloud visualizations overlaid on camera images demonstrate this characteristic: dense \ac{LiDAR} coverage appears on vessels, buoys, and other solid objects, while water surfaces produce few or no returns.
For grid-based clustering, this characteristic prevents false positives from wave crests or foam patterns.

The Livox Horizon configuration provides several capabilities essential for comparing object detection performance.
The system achieves 2.25× more points within the camera view compared to omnidirectional spinning sensors, while the non-repetitive scan pattern enhances sampling density through temporal aggregation.
Per-point timestamps and \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} integration enable accurate aggregation during motion, while PTP synchronization provides sub-microsecond timing accuracy relative to cameras and \ac{GPS}.
Factory-configured multi-sensor calibration unifies point clouds from three sensors before transmission, and the 905 nm wavelength reduces maritime clutter by rejecting water returns.
Combined with the software integration and synchronization infrastructure described in Section 3.2, this configuration enables rigorous \ac{LiDAR} detection evaluation and comparison with vision-based approaches in Chapters 5 and 6.

            \subsubsection{Pinpoint GPS/INS}

The Pinpoint \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} performs two critical functions in the Minion perception system: providing precise global time for sensor synchronization, and tracking vessel position and orientation for motion correction of \ac{LiDAR} data.
The \ac{GPS} receiver functions as the master clock for the entire synchronization hierarchy described in Section 3.2.2.1, while the integrated \ac{IMU} enables high-rate pose updates between \ac{GPS} fixes.

Global Navigation Satellite System signals inherently carry highly accurate timing information, as satellite positioning operates through precise measurement of signal delay from multiple satellites with synchronized atomic clocks.
The Pinpoint receiver extracts this timing information and distributes it over the vessel's network using Network Time Protocol.
The \ac{GPS} unit was assigned a static IP address of 201.7.90.30 on the Minion network and configured to broadcast \ac{GPS}-disciplined time via Network Time Protocol.
The Atlas PC main computer synchronizes its clock to this \ac{GPS} source with typical accuracy in the tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, limited primarily by network latency rather than \ac{GPS} accuracy.

This \ac{GPS} time reference propagates through the synchronization hierarchy to every computing resource on the platform.
Atlas functions as a Network Time Protocol server for the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier camera computer, which subsequently operates as a Precision Time Protocol master for the Livox Horizon \ac{LiDAR} sensors.
This cascaded approach ensures timestamps from all sensors—cameras, \ac{LiDAR}, and \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS}—share a common time reference traceable to \ac{GPS} time.

Beyond timekeeping, the \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} system continuously tracks platform position and orientation, which is required for \ac{LiDAR} temporal aggregation.
As described in Section 3.1.1.3, accumulating \ac{LiDAR} points over several seconds necessitates compensation for vessel motion during that period.
The Pinpoint system fuses \ac{GPS} position measurements with \ac{IMU} acceleration and rotation data through an Extended Kalman Filter to produce pose estimates at rates substantially higher than \ac{GPS} alone could provide.
\ac{GPS} fixes arrive at 1-10 Hz depending on satellite visibility, while the \ac{IMU} operates at hundreds of hertz.
The fusion algorithm propagates pose estimates forward using \ac{IMU} integration between \ac{GPS} updates, subsequently correcting accumulated drift when new \ac{GPS} measurements arrive.

The resulting pose solution provides six-degree-of-freedom state estimates—three-dimensional position and three-dimensional orientation—at sufficient temporal resolution to interpolate platform pose to the exact timestamp of each \ac{LiDAR} point.
This capability supports the transformation methodology presented in Chapter 5, where \ac{LiDAR} points acquired at different times during motion are transformed to a common reference frame before projection onto camera images.

The Pinpoint \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} connects to the Minion computing infrastructure via Ethernet, utilizing both Network Time Protocol for time distribution and User Datagram Protocol for pose data transmission.
\ac{ROS} driver nodes on the Atlas PC receive and parse the binary \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} messages, publishing pose estimates as standard \ac{ROS} geometry messages.
These messages incorporate position (latitude, longitude, altitude), orientation (roll, pitch, yaw), uncertainty estimates, and \ac{GPS} fix quality flags.
The \ac{ROS} tf2 library consumes these pose estimates to maintain the time-varying transformation tree relating sensor frames to platform and world frames, enabling automated coordinate transformation for sensor fusion.

The \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} defines the inertial reference frame for the platform, with position expressed in geographic coordinates (WGS84 datum) and orientation relative to true north and local gravity.
This world-referenced system serves as the common reference for transforming observations from multiple sensors acquired at different times during motion.
Transformation from sensor-local frames to the \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} world frame requires knowledge of sensor-to-platform extrinsic calibration parameters.
These parameters are determined through calibration procedures described in Section 3.2.1.2 for cameras and Section 3.2.1.3 for \ac{LiDAR} sensors.
With extrinsic parameters established, the \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} pose solution enables transformation of any sensor observation to world coordinates or to any other sensor's reference frame.

Maritime environments present challenges for \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} systems that differ from land vehicle applications.
Water surface reflections induce multipath interference in \ac{GPS} signals, while vessel pitch and roll motion exercises the full range of the \ac{IMU}.
The Pinpoint system was designed for marine applications and incorporates algorithms to address these factors while maintaining accuracy during vessel maneuvering.
\ac{GPS} accuracy degrades in areas with limited satellite visibility, such as proximity to tall structures, bridges, or fjord-like coastal terrain.
The \ac{IMU} provides short-term pose continuity during \ac{GPS} outages, though accumulated drift limits the duration for which pure inertial navigation remains accurate.
Data collection operations were conducted in open water with favorable satellite visibility, ensuring consistent \ac{GPS} fix quality throughout recording sessions.

The \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} system enables two functions essential for multi-modal sensor fusion research.
First, \ac{GPS}-disciplined time distributed to all sensors ensures timestamps from cameras, \ac{LiDAR}, and \ac{GPS} itself reference the same time base, providing frame-accurate temporal association across modalities.
Second, continuous pose estimates enable transformation of temporally distributed observations to common reference frames, supporting \ac{LiDAR} aggregation during motion and registration of sensor fields of view for fusion operations.
Combined with the synchronization verification and drift correction procedures described in Section 3.2.2, these capabilities establish the temporal and spatial foundation for rigorous object detection performance evaluation across sensing modalities.
The \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} thus functions not merely as a navigation sensor but as critical infrastructure enabling the multi-modal perception analysis central to this research.
