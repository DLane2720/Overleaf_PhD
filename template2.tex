\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Significance of Study}

The development of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) represents a significant technological advancement requiring sophisticated perception systems capable of detecting and classifying maritime objects with high accuracy and reliability in real-time operational environments. As ASV technology advances toward practical deployment in commercial and research applications, understanding the comparative performance characteristics of different sensing modalities and their integration through sensor fusion methodologies becomes critical for effective system design and operational safety assurance.

The advancement of autonomous surface vessel technology has gained significant momentum through comprehensive research programs and competitive evaluation platforms such as the Maritime RobotX Challenge, where multidisciplinary teams develop and test ASV platforms under realistic maritime operational conditions. These research platforms serve as essential testbeds for evaluating perception technologies under actual environmental constraints, providing valuable empirical insights into sensor performance characteristics, real-time processing capabilities, and complex system integration challenges that cannot be adequately assessed through simulation alone.

Research platforms provide critical opportunities for real-world validation of perception algorithms under actual maritime conditions with operational time constraints. These platforms enable comprehensive comparative analysis opportunities for evaluating different sensor modalities and advanced sensor fusion approaches under controlled yet realistic testing scenarios. Furthermore, research platforms facilitate essential technology transfer pathways from experimental research systems to operational ASV deployments requiring robust real-time performance guarantees. Finally, these platforms enable systematic performance benchmarking that supports rigorous evaluation of detection accuracy, classification reliability, and sensor fusion effectiveness across diverse maritime operational scenarios.

Current ASV development faces a significant knowledge gap regarding the quantitative performance characteristics of different sensing modalities and their integration methodologies in complex maritime environments. While individual sensor technologies, particularly Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems and vision-based cameras, have been extensively studied and validated in terrestrial applications, their comparative performance characteristics and sensor fusion integration capabilities in maritime contexts lack systematic quantitative analysis with emphasis on real-time processing constraints and computational efficiency requirements.

Comprehensive performance analysis requires systematic detection accuracy comparison between LiDAR-based systems utilizing Grid-Based Clustering and Concave Hull Extraction (GB-CACHE) processing and vision-based systems implementing You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithms. Additionally, rigorous classification performance evaluation across diverse maritime object types using advanced machine learning algorithms must be conducted to establish performance baselines. Assessment of training requirements for machine learning-based classification systems, particularly focusing on data efficiency and convergence characteristics, represents another critical analytical requirement. Real-time processing capabilities and computational efficiency evaluation under operational constraints must be systematically analyzed to ensure practical deployment feasibility. Moreover, sensor fusion effectiveness evaluation, specifically examining bounding box confidence integration methodologies, requires comprehensive analysis to determine optimal multi-modal processing approaches. Finally, environmental robustness evaluation across varying maritime conditions, including different weather states, lighting conditions, and sea states, must be conducted to ensure reliable operational performance.

ASV perception systems must reliably detect and classify a diverse range of maritime objects that are critical for safe autonomous navigation, requiring robust algorithms capable of real-time processing under challenging environmental conditions. The maritime environment presents unique detection challenges due to varying lighting conditions, wave-induced platform motion, and the diverse physical characteristics of navigation-critical objects that must be accurately identified and classified. Navigation buoys, including Polyform A-2 and A-3 buoys available in various colors for channel marking and navigation guidance, represent primary detection targets requiring high accuracy classification. Regulatory markers, specifically Sur-Mark tall buoys designed for navigation reference and hazard identification, present distinct detection challenges due to their geometric characteristics and operational deployment contexts. Light towers serving as active navigation aids provide both visual and electronic guidance signals, requiring detection algorithms capable of handling variable illumination and signaling states. Various vessels, including recreational boats and commercial watercraft, represent dynamic detection targets with diverse size, shape, and motion characteristics that complicate reliable classification. Maritime infrastructure elements, including docks, piers, and other fixed navigational hazards, require robust detection capabilities to ensure safe autonomous navigation in complex harbor and coastal environments.

% \subsection{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Problem Statement: Performance Comparison Gap}

Despite the growing operational importance of autonomous surface vessels and the significant maturation of individual sensor technologies over the past decade, there exists a critical and well-documented gap in quantitative performance comparison between different sensing modalities specifically applied to maritime object detection and classification tasks. Current ASV development efforts lack systematic analytical frameworks for evaluating how LiDAR-based systems utilizing advanced point cloud processing algorithms perform relative to vision-based systems implementing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches when deployed in realistic maritime operational environments.

Existing research efforts in maritime object detection and classification have primarily focused on individual sensor implementations and algorithm development without conducting comprehensive comparative analysis that would inform optimal sensor selection and integration strategies for operational ASV systems. Contemporary research demonstrates a predominant focus on LiDAR-only implementations that emphasize point cloud processing methodologies and clustering algorithms specifically adapted for maritime environments, yet these studies typically lack comparative evaluation against alternative sensing modalities. Similarly, vision-only system research emphasizes deep learning approaches for maritime object recognition, particularly convolutional neural network architectures, but generally operates in isolation without systematic comparison to LiDAR-based approaches. The limited cross-modal comparison studies that do exist provide insufficient quantitative performance metrics and lack standardized evaluation frameworks necessary for meaningful comparative analysis. Furthermore, there exists a notable absence of standardized evaluation frameworks specifically designed for maritime perception systems, hindering systematic comparison and technology advancement across research groups and commercial developers.

The absence of comprehensive quantitative performance analysis leaves fundamental technical and operational questions unanswered for ASV system designers and engineers responsible for developing reliable autonomous navigation systems. Critical questions regarding detection and classification performance remain inadequately addressed in current research literature. Specifically, the comparative detection accuracy performance of LiDAR-based systems utilizing GB-CACHE processing versus vision-based systems implementing YOLO algorithms for specific maritime object types requires systematic investigation. The precision and recall characteristics of each sensing modality across different object classes under varying environmental conditions need quantitative evaluation to inform sensor selection decisions. Training requirements, including data volume, computational resources, and convergence time, differ significantly between LiDAR feature-based approaches and vision-based deep learning methodologies, yet these differences lack systematic quantification. Computational overhead associated with each sensing modality for real-time operation, including processing latency and resource utilization, requires comprehensive analysis to ensure practical deployment feasibility. Additionally, the effectiveness of sensor fusion methodologies, particularly bounding box confidence integration approaches, needs rigorous evaluation to determine optimal multi-modal processing strategies for enhanced detection performance.

% \subsection{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Problem Statement: Sensor Fusion Challenges}

Autonomous surface vessels require precise integration of multiple sensing modalities to achieve reliable object detection and classification performance that meets operational safety standards for autonomous navigation. A fundamental and persistent challenge in ASV perception system development lies in establishing and maintaining accurate spatial and temporal calibration between LiDAR and camera systems under dynamic maritime operational conditions that present unique environmental challenges not encountered in terrestrial applications.

Multi-sensor ASV platforms face unique spatial calibration requirements that differ significantly from terrestrial applications due to the dynamic nature of maritime environments and the continuous mechanical stresses imposed by marine operational conditions. Environmental factors affecting calibration present ongoing challenges for maintaining sensor alignment accuracy. Platform motion induced by wave action creates continuous roll, pitch, and yaw movements that affect sensor alignment and require robust calibration maintenance strategies. Vibration and mechanical stress inherent in marine environments cause gradual calibration drift that can degrade sensor fusion performance over extended operational periods. Temperature variations in maritime environments affect sensor mounting structures and optical characteristics, potentially introducing systematic calibration errors that must be compensated through adaptive calibration procedures. Saltwater corrosion presents long-term challenges by potentially altering sensor mounting hardware characteristics over extended deployment periods, requiring regular calibration validation and maintenance protocols.

Precision requirements for effective sensor fusion establish demanding performance specifications for calibration maintenance systems that must operate reliably under dynamic maritime conditions. Sub-pixel accuracy calibration is essential for accurate LiDAR point cloud projection onto camera images, enabling effective correlation between sensor modalities for object detection applications and ensuring that spatial relationships between sensors remain consistent across operational scenarios. Millimeter-level precision in spatial calibration is required for effective object detection correlation between LiDAR and vision systems, particularly for small maritime objects such as navigation buoys where detection accuracy directly impacts navigation safety. Consistent calibration maintenance across varying operational conditions, including different sea states and weather conditions, requires robust calibration validation procedures that can adapt to changing environmental parameters. Real-time calibration validation capabilities are necessary for detecting calibration degradation during operation and implementing corrective measures to maintain sensor fusion performance without interrupting autonomous navigation operations.

\subsection{Limitations and Assumptions}

This research investigation is conducted using Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Minion ASV research platform and utilizes sensor data collected during the 2024 Maritime RobotX Challenge competition, which establishes specific operational and methodological constraints that define the scope and applicability of research findings.

Platform-specific limitations inherent in this research approach must be acknowledged and considered when interpreting results and their broader applicability. Research findings are specifically applicable to ERAU's Minion research platform design, including its particular sensor mounting configuration, platform dynamics characteristics, and operational capabilities, which may not directly translate to other ASV platform designs. The competition environment context, where primary data collection occurred during RobotX challenge events, may not represent the full spectrum of maritime operational conditions encountered in commercial or military ASV deployments. Geographic constraints imposed by conducting testing in competition and training areas introduce environmental characteristics that may not be representative of other maritime operational regions. Operational scenarios focused on RobotX challenge tasks may not encompass the complete range of potential ASV mission requirements and environmental conditions encountered in practical autonomous vessel operations.

This research focuses on specific maritime object categories that are relevant to RobotX competition scenarios and representative of typical ASV navigation challenges, while acknowledging that maritime environments contain additional object types not addressed in this investigation. The research addresses six primary object classes that represent critical navigation elements in maritime environments. Tall buoys, specifically Sur-Mark regulatory buoys with standardized dimensions of 39-inch height, 10-inch column diameter, and 18-inch ring diameter, represent regulatory navigation markers requiring reliable detection and classification. Polyform A-2 buoys, measuring 14.5 inches by 19.5 inches and available in red, green, blue, and black color variants, serve as channel markers and navigation references requiring color-specific classification capabilities. Polyform A-3 buoys, with dimensions of 17 inches by 23 inches and identical color availability, represent larger navigation buoys requiring robust detection across varying distances and environmental conditions. Light towers function as active navigation aids incorporating electronic and visual signaling capabilities, presenting detection challenges due to variable illumination states and complex geometric structures. Jon boats, characterized as flat-bottom chase boats utilized in competition and training scenarios, represent small vessel detection targets with distinct geometric and motion characteristics. Sailboats, including recreational sailing vessels commonly encountered in competition environments, represent larger vessel detection targets with variable configuration due to sail and rigging arrangements.

\chapter{Review of the Relevant Literature}

% Note: All in-text citations should appear as \cite{einstein}

\acp{USV} have emerged as essential platforms capable of performing dangerous, dirty, and cumbersome tasks that exceed human capability. These vessels are pivotal in various maritime operations, including environmental monitoring, search and rescue missions, and resource exploration \cite{liebergall, eckstein2024}.% [1], [2]. 
Their ability to operate independently with minimal human intervention has significantly enhanced operational efficiency and safety at sea \cite{bai2022}.%[3].

Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings but primarily rely on some combination of visual information through a camera and spatial data provided by LiDAR \cite{yeong2021}.%[4]. 
Each sensing modality offers distinct advantages: visual data provides rich color and texture information, while LiDAR delivers precise spatial measurements of the surrounding environment. 
Real-time object detection methods have been developed for both sensing modalities, leveraging deep learning architectures. 
Object detection with visual data often employs transfer learning on pre-trained convolutional neural networks such as ResNet \cite{he2016} and You Only Look Once (YOLO) \cite{ultralytics}.%[6]. 
Similarly, LiDAR-based object detection can be performed using point-based algorithms like PointNet \cite{garcia-garcia2016}, voxel-based methods such as VoxelNet \cite{zhou2018a}, or hybrid approaches like PV-RCNN \cite{shi2021}.%[9]. 
Despite these advancements, each modality has inherent limitations—vision-based systems struggle with poor lighting conditions and occlusions, while LiDAR data can be sparse and affected by water reflections.

To address these limitations, sensor fusion techniques have been explored as a means of combining the strengths of both modalities. 
Research into sensor fusion methods dates back to military applications in the 1980s and has gained significant traction in the last 15 years, particularly due to interest from the automotive industry in autonomous driving technologies. However, no unified approach has been established for optimal sensor fusion, with ongoing debates regarding the best fusion strategies (e.g., early, mid, or late fusion) and their trade-offs concerning computational efficiency and accuracy.

While research in the automotive sector has contributed significantly to sensor fusion methodologies \cite{yeong2021,clunie2021,roriz2022,cui2022,das2022,liu2023a}, direct application to maritime environments remains challenging due to fundamental environmental differences. 
Automotive environments are highly structured, with well-defined lanes, uniform object classes, and relatively predictable lighting conditions. 
In contrast, the maritime environment introduces additional complexities, including dynamic vehicle motion induced by wind and waves, variable scene density (ranging from sparse open waters to congested littoral zones), and specular reflections on the water surface that can interfere with both vision-based \cite{liu2023a} and LiDAR-based object detection \cite{ahmed2024}.%[15]. 
These factors necessitate domain-specific adaptations of sensor fusion architectures to ensure robust real-time object detection for \acp{USV}. 
However, the lack of available maritime-specific datasets \cite{jun-hwa2022,su2023,thompson2023} creates an additional challenge.

Given these challenges, further research is needed to enhance sensor fusion methodologies for maritime applications. 
Key areas of investigation include efficient feature selection tailored to maritime object classes, the development of lightweight fusion architectures suited for real-time processing, and an evaluation of computational requirements for deployment on \ac{USV} hardware. 
Addressing these research gaps will contribute to the advancement of autonomous maritime perception, enhancing the operational capabilities of \acp{USV} in complex and dynamic environments.
