% \subsubsection{Camera Calibration} \label{sec:camera_intriniscs_results}

Camera calibration was performed using a newly fabricated checkerboard target, shown in Figures~\ref{fig:checkerboard_old} and~\ref{fig:checkerboard_new}.  
The target consists of a 6$\times$9 grid of 100~mm squares, providing 40 corner features for registration.  
Thirty HDR images were captured with the checkerboard placed at positions spanning the horizontal field of view and distances between five and 40~m.
These images were then processed with MATLAB Camera Calibration app \cite{matlab_calibration}, which was successful in detecting the checkerboard in 23 separate frames.  
This initial process provided a set of camera intrinsic values with a mean pixel error of 0.63~pixels (Figure~\ref{fig:HDR_calib_error}).

% The resulting transformation achieved sub-degree rotational and centimeter-level translational accuracy, sufficient for reliable fusion and object detection.
