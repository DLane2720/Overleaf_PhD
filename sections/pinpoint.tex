% The Minion platform features a PinPoint \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} equipped with dual-antennae for orientation and differential corrections for millimeter precision geolocation.
% The sensor performs two critical functions for the \ac{USV}: tracking vessel position and orientation, and precise global time for sensor synchronization.
% The \ac{GPS} receiver functions as the master clock for the entire synchronization hierarchy described in ~\ref{time_sync}, while the integrated \ac{IMU} enables high-rate pose updates between \ac{GPS} fixes.

The Minion \ac{USV} employs a Torc Robotics Pinpoint \ac{GPS}/\ac{INS} unit for both global positioning and inertial navigation capabilities.
This device integrates a differential-corrected \ac{GPS} receiver with a multi-axis \ac{IMU} and dual antenna, providing precise position, velocity, and orientation data for the autonomous platform.
The \ac{GPS} receiver is configured to operate at an update rate of five Hz, while the integrated \ac{IMU} provides high-frequency inertial measurements at 105.4 Hz.
The Pinpoint unit delivers timing accuracy on the order of 10-100 nanoseconds for \ac{GPS}-disciplined time signals, which is a critical function for multi-sensor synchronization discussed in Section~\ref{time_sync}.
