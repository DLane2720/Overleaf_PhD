\section{Late Fusion} \label{late_fusion}

% \subsection{Intro}
% Introduce fusion and late fusion

% \subsection{late fusion method}
% fuse bounding boxes from YOLO with projected object bounds from GB-CACHE

% Kalman filter type reliability factor from each to produce more accurate bounds

% \paragraph{Limitations}
% corrections to GB-CACHE perimeter vertices.

% Limitations of YOLO resolution
